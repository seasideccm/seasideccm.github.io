## Capnodynamic monitoring of lung volume and blood flow in response to increased positive end-expiratory pressure in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia: an observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia remains debated and should ideally be guided by responses in both lung volume and perfusion. Capnodynamic monitoring allows both end-expiratory lung volume ([Formula: see text]) and effective pulmonary blood flow (EPBF) to be determined at the bedside with ongoing ventilation. 

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19-related moderate to severe respiratory failure underwent capnodynamic monitoring of [Formula: see text] and EPBF during a step increase in PEEP by 50% above the baseline (PEEP(low) to PEEP(high)). The primary outcome was a > 20 mm Hg increase in arterial oxygen tension to inspired fraction of oxygen (P/F) ratio to define responders versus non-responders. Secondary outcomes included changes in physiological dead space and correlations with independently determined recruited lung volume and the recruitment-to-inflation ratio at an instantaneous, single breath decrease in PEEP. Mixed factor ANOVA for group mean differences and correlations by Pearson's correlation coefficient are reported including their 95% confidence intervals. 

RESULTS: Of 27 patients studied, 15 responders increased the P/F ratio by 55 [24-86] mm Hg compared to 12 non-responders (p < 0.01) as PEEP(low) (11 ± 2.7 cm H(2)O) was increased to PEEP(high) (18 ± 3.0 cm H(2)O). The [Formula: see text] was 461 [82-839] ml less in responders at PEEP(low) (p = 0.02) but not statistically different between groups at PEEP(high). Responders increased both [Formula: see text] and EPBF at PEEP(high) (r = 0.56 [0.18-0.83], p = 0.03). In contrast, non-responders demonstrated a negative correlation (r = - 0.65 [- 0.12 to - 0.89], p = 0.02) with increased lung volume associated with decreased pulmonary perfusion. Decreased (- 0.06 [- 0.02 to - 0.09] %, p < 0.01) dead space was observed in responders. The change in [Formula: see text] correlated with both the recruited lung volume (r = 0.85 [0.69-0.93], p < 0.01) and the recruitment-to-inflation ratio (r = 0.87 [0.74-0.94], p < 0.01). 

CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory failure, improved oxygenation in response to increased PEEP was associated with increased end-expiratory lung volume and pulmonary perfusion. The change in end-expiratory lung volume was positively correlated with the lung volume recruited and the recruitment-to-inflation ratio. This study demonstrates the feasibility of capnodynamic monitoring to assess physiological responses to PEEP at the bedside to facilitate an individualised setting of PEEP.

##中文标题- 在中至重度COVID-19肺炎中对呼气末正压增加应答的肺容量和血流量的二氧化碳动态监测：一项观察性研究

**摘要**

背景：COVID-19肺炎机械通气期间呼气末正压(PEEP)的最佳水平仍有争议，理想情况下应通过肺容量和灌注的反应进行指导。二氧化碳监测仪允许在持续通气的情况下，在床边测定呼气末肺容量（[公式：见正文]）和有效肺血流量(EPBF)。

方法：COVID-19相关的中度至重度呼吸衰竭患者在PEEP较基线增加50%（PEEP（低）至PEEP（高））的过程中接受了二氧化碳动力学监测[公式：见文本]和EPBF。主要结局是动脉血氧分压与吸入气中的氧气分数(P/F)比值增加 > 20 mmHg，以定义应答者与非应答者。次要结局包括生理死腔的变化以及与独立确定的肺复张体积和PEEP中单次呼吸瞬时减少时的肺复张/充气比的相关性。报告了组平均差异的混合因素ANOVA和Pearson相关系数的相关性，包括其95%置信区间。

结果：在研究的27例患者中，15例应答者的P/F比增加了55[24-86]mm Hg，而12例无应答者(P < 0.01)，因为PEEP（低）(11±2.7 cm h2)O）增加至PEEP（高）(18±3.0 cm h2)O）。PEEP（低）时应答者的[公式：见文本]少461[82-839]ml(p = 0.02)，但PEEP（高）时组间无统计学差异。应答者增加了[公式：见正文]和PEEP时的EPBF（高）(r = 0.56[0.18-0.83]，p = 0.03)。相反，无应答者表现出与肺灌注减少相关的肺容量增加呈负相关（r =-0.65[-0.12至-0.89]，p = 0.02）。在反应者中观察到死腔减少（-0.06[-0.02至-0.09]%，p < 0.01）。[公式：见正文]中的变化与肺容量(r = 0.85[0.69-0.93]，p < 0.01)和肺通气比(r = 0.87[0.74-0.94]，p < 0.01)相关。

结论：在中度至重度COVID-19呼吸衰竭的机械通气患者中，PEEP增加导致的氧合改善与呼气末肺容量和肺灌注增加相关。呼气末肺容积的变化与肺容积招募和招募-充气比呈正相关。这项研究表明，二氧化碳监测仪在床边评估PEEP的生理反应，以促进PEEP个体化设置的可行性。

## Influence of temperature management at 33 °C versus normothermia on survival in patients with vasopressor support after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a post hoc analysis of the TTM-2 trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management at 33 °C (TTM33) has been employed in effort to mitigate brain injury in unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Current guidelines recommend prevention of fever, not excluding TTM33. The main objective of this study was to investigate if TTM33 is associated with mortality in patients with vasopressor support on admission after OHCA. 

METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of patients included in the TTM-2 trial, an international, multicenter trial, investigating outcomes in unconscious adult OHCA patients randomized to TTM33 versus normothermia. Patients were grouped according to level of circulatory support on admission: (1) no-vasopressor support, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) ≥ 70 mmHg; (2) moderate-vasopressor support MAP < 70 mmHg or any dose of dopamine/dobutamine or noradrenaline/adrenaline dose ≤ 0.25 µg/kg/min; and (3) high-vasopressor support, noradrenaline/adrenaline dose > 0.25 µg/kg/min. Hazard ratios with TTM33 were calculated for all-cause 180-day mortality in these groups. 

RESULTS: The TTM-2 trial enrolled 1900 patients. Data on primary outcome were available for 1850 patients, with 662, 896, and 292 patients in the, no-, moderate-, or high-vasopressor support groups, respectively. Hazard ratio for 180-day mortality was 1.04 [98.3% CI 0.78-1.39] in the no-, 1.22 [98.3% CI 0.97-1.53] in the moderate-, and 0.97 [98.3% CI 0.68-1.38] in the high-vasopressor support groups with regard to TTM33. Results were consistent in an imputed, adjusted sensitivity analysis. 

CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, temperature control at 33 °C after OHCA, compared to normothermia, was not associated with higher incidence of death in patients stratified according to vasopressor support on admission.

##中文标题- 在院外心脏骤停后接受血管加压素支持的患者中，33 °C温度管理与正常体温对生存的影响：TTM-2试验的事后分析

背景：已采用33 ℃(TTM33)的目标温度管理来减轻院外心脏骤停(OHCA)无意识存活者的脑损伤。当前指南推荐预防发热，不包括TTM33。本研究的主要目的是调查TTM33是否与OHCA后入院时接受血管加压药支持的患者的死亡率相关。

方法：我们对TTM-2试验中纳入的患者进行了事后分析，这是一项国际、多中心试验，调查随机分配至TTM33组与正常体温组的无意识成人OHCA患者的结局。患者根据入院时循环支持水平分组：(1)无血管加压支持，平均动脉血压(MAP)≥70 mmHg；(2)中-血管加压支持MAP < 70 mmHg或任何剂量的多巴胺/多巴酚丁胺或去甲肾上腺素/肾上腺素剂量≤0.25µg/kg/min；(3)高血管加压支持，去甲肾上腺素剂量 > 0.25µg/kg/min。计算这些组中全因180天死亡率与TTM33的风险比。

结果：TTM-2试验入组了1900例患者。获得了1850例患者的主要结局数据，其中662、896和292例患者分别属于血管加压药支持组、无血管加压药支持组、血管加压药支持组和高血管加压药支持组。就TTM33而言，编号、中等和高剂量升压药支持组的180天死亡率风险比分别为1.04[98.3%CI 0.78-1.39]、1.22[98.3%CI 0.97-1.53]和0.97[98.3%CI 0.68-1.38]。在插补的校正敏感性分析中，结果一致。

结论：在这项探索性分析中，与正常体温相比，OHCA后温度控制在33 ℃与入院时血管加压素支持分层的患者更高的死亡率无关。

## Clustering identifies endotypes of traumatic brain injury in an intensive care cohort: a CENTER-TBI study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: While the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is one of the strongest outcome predictors, the current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' based on this fails to capture enormous heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment response. We hypothesized that data-driven characterization of TBI could identify distinct endotypes and give mechanistic insights. 

METHODS: We developed an unsupervised statistical clustering model based on a mixture of probabilistic graphs for presentation (< 24 h) demographic, clinical, physiological, laboratory and imaging data to identify subgroups of TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit in the CENTER-TBI dataset (N = 1,728). A cluster similarity index was used for robust determination of optimal cluster number. Mutual information was used to quantify feature importance and for cluster interpretation. 

RESULTS: Six stable endotypes were identified with distinct GCS and composite systemic metabolic stress profiles, distinguished by GCS, blood lactate, oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, glucose, base excess, pH, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and body temperature. Notably, a cluster with 'moderate' TBI (by traditional classification) and deranged metabolic profile, had a worse outcome than a cluster with 'severe' GCS and a normal metabolic profile. Addition of cluster labels significantly improved the prognostic precision of the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical trials in TBI) extended model, for prediction of both unfavourable outcome and mortality (both p < 0.001). 

CONCLUSIONS: Six stable and clinically distinct TBI endotypes were identified by probabilistic unsupervised clustering. In addition to presenting neurology, a profile of biochemical derangement was found to be an important distinguishing feature that was both biologically plausible and associated with outcome. Our work motivates refining current TBI classifications with factors describing metabolic stress. Such data-driven clusters suggest TBI endotypes that merit investigation to identify bespoke treatment strategies to improve care.

##中文标题- 一项CENTER-TBI研究：在重症监护队列中确定创伤性脑损伤的基因型

**摘要**

背景：虽然格拉斯哥昏迷量表(GCS)是最强的结局预测因子之一，但基于此，目前将创伤性脑损伤(TBI)分类为“轻度”、“中度”或“重度”未能发现病理生理学和治疗反应存在巨大的异质性。我们假设，数据驱动的TBI特征描述可识别不同的内表型并提供机制见解。

方法：我们基于展示(< 24h)人口统计学、临床、生理学、实验室和影像学数据的概率图混合，开发了一种无监督统计聚类模型，以确定CENTER-TBI数据集中入住重症监护室的TBI患者亚组(N = 1,728)。使用簇相似性指数稳健确定最佳簇数。互信息用于量化特征重要性和集群解释。

结果：根据GCS、血乳酸、血氧饱和度、血清肌酐、葡萄糖、碱剩余、pH值、动脉血二氧化碳分压和体温等指标，鉴定出6种具有不同GCS和复合全身代谢应激特征的稳定基因型。值得注意的是，“中度”TBI（按传统分类）和代谢轮廓紊乱的集群比“重度”GCS和代谢轮廓正常的集群结局更差。添加集群标签显著改善了IMPACT（TBI临床试验国际预后和分析任务）扩展模型的预后精确度，用于预测不利结局和死亡率（均为p < 0.001）。

结论：通过概率无监督TBI聚类确定了6个稳定的和临床上不同的内表型。除了呈现神经病学外，发现生化紊乱特征是一项重要的显着特征，在生物学上是合理的且与结局相关。我们的工作促进了用描述代谢应激的因素改进目前的TBI分类。这些数据驱动的群组表明TBI的基因型值得研究来确定定制的治疗策略以改善治疗。

## Optimizing PO(2) during peripheral veno-arterial ECMO: a narrative review

**Abstract**

During refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is used to restore a circulatory output. However, it also impacts significantly arterial oxygenation. Recent guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) recommend targeting postoxygenator partial pressure of oxygen (P(POST)O(2)) around 150 mmHg. In this narrative review, we intend to summarize the rationale and evidence for this P(POST)O(2) target recommendation. Because this is the most used configuration, we focus on peripheral VA-ECMO. To date, clinicians do not know how to set the sweep gas oxygen fraction (F(S)O(2)). Because of the oxygenator's performance, arterial hyperoxemia is common during VA-ECMO support. Interpretation of oxygenation is complex in this setting because of the dual circulation phenomenon, depending on both the native cardiac output and the VA-ECMO blood flow. Such dual circulation results in dual oxygenation, with heterogeneous oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) along the aorta, and heterogeneous oxygenation between organs, depending on the mixing zone location. Data regarding oxygenation during VA-ECMO are scarce, but several observational studies have reported an association between hyperoxemia and mortality, especially after refractory cardiac arrest. While hyperoxemia should be avoided, there are also more and more studies in non-ECMO patients suggesting the harm of a too restrictive oxygenation strategy. Finally, setting F(S)O(2) to target strict normoxemia is challenging because continuous monitoring of postoxygenator oxygen saturation is not widely available. The threshold of P(POST)O(2) around 150 mmHg is supported by limited evidence but aims at respecting a safe margin, avoiding both hypoxemia and severe hyperoxemia.

##中文标题- 外周静脉-动脉ECMO期间优化PO(2)：叙述性综述

**摘要**

难治性心源性休克和心脏骤停期间，利用静脉-动脉体外膜肺氧合(VA-ECMO)来恢复循环输出。但是，其也会显著影响动脉氧合。体外生命支持组织(ELSO)近期指南建议将氧合器后氧分压(P(POST)O(2))目标值设定在150 mmHg左右。在本叙述性综述中，我们将总结本P(POST)O(2)目标推荐的依据和证据。由于这是最常用的配置，我们重点关注外周VA-ECMO。迄今为止，临床医生不知道如何设置清扫气体氧分数(F(S)O(2))。由于氧合器的性能，在VA-ECMO支持期间，动脉高血氧症很常见。由于存在双循环现象，在这种情况下，氧合作用的解释很复杂，取决于自体心输出量和VA-ECMO血流量。这种双重循环导致双重氧合，沿主动脉的氧分压(PO(2))不均匀，器官之间的氧合不均匀，取决于混合区的位置。关于VA-ECMO期间氧合的数据很少，但一些观察性研究报告了高血氧症与死亡率之间的相关性，尤其是难治性心脏骤停后。虽然应避免高血氧症，但也越来越多的非ECMO患者的研究表明，氧合策略过于限制性的危害。最后，将F(S)O(2)设定为严格的正常血氧饱和度目标具有挑战性，因为氧合器后氧饱和度的连续监测尚未广泛应用。有限的证据支持P(POST)O(2)的阈值在150 mmHg左右，但其目的是为了保证安全范围，避免低氧血症和重度高血氧症。

## Acute kidney injury in critical COVID-19: a multicenter cohort analysis in seven large hospitals in Belgium

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported as a frequent complication of critical COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of AKI and use of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in critical COVID-19, to assess patient and kidney outcomes and risk factors for AKI and differences in outcome when the diagnosis of AKI is based on urine output (UO) or on serum creatinine (sCr). 

METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis of patients with critical COVID-19 in seven large hospitals in Belgium. AKI was defined according to KDIGO within 21 days after ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors for developing AKI and to assess the association between AKI and ICU mortality. 

RESULTS: Of 1286 patients, 85.1% had AKI, and KRT was used in 9.8%. Older age, obesity, a higher APACHE II score and use of mechanical ventilation at day 1 of ICU stay were associated with an increased risk for AKI. After multivariable adjustment, all AKI stages were associated with ICU mortality. AKI was based on sCr in 40.1% and UO in 81.5% of patients. All AKI stages based on sCr and AKI stage 3 based on UO were associated with ICU mortality. Persistent AKI was present in 88.6% and acute kidney disease (AKD) in 87.6%. Rapid reversal of AKI yielded a better prognosis compared to persistent AKI and AKD. Kidney recovery was observed in 47.4% of surviving AKI patients. 

CONCLUSIONS: Over 80% of critically ill COVID-19 patients had AKI. This was driven by the high occurrence rate of AKI defined by UO criteria. All AKI stages were associated with mortality (NCT04997915).

##中文标题- 关键COVID-19中的急性肾损伤：比利时7家大型医院的多中心队列分析

**摘要**

背景：急性肾损伤(AKI)被报告为关键COVID-19的常见并发症。我们旨在评价关键COVID-19中AKI的发生和肾脏替代治疗(KRT)的使用，以评估当AKI基于尿量(UO)或血清肌酐(sCr)诊断时，患者和肾脏结局以及AKI的风险因素和结局差异。

方法：对比利时7家大型医院的关键COVID-19患者进行多中心、回顾性队列分析。入ICU 21天内根据KDIGO定义AKI。采用多因素logistic回归分析探索发生AKI的危险因素，评估AKI与ICU死亡率的相关性。

结果：1286例患者中，85.1%发生AKI，9.8%使用KRT。年龄较大、肥胖、APACHE II评分较高和在ICU住院第1天使用机械通气与AKI风险增加相关。多变量调整后，所有AKI分期均与ICU死亡率相关。40.1%的AKI患者基于sCr，81.5%的AKI患者基于UO。基于sCr的所有AKI分期和基于UO的AKI 3期与ICU死亡率相关。持续性AKI占88.6%，急性肾病(AKD)占87.6%。与持续性AKI和AKD相比，AKI的快速逆转产生更好的预后。在47.4%的AKI存活患者中观察到肾脏恢复。

结论：超过80%的COVID-19重症患者伴有AKI。这是由UO标准定义的高AKI发生率驱动的。所有AKI分期均与死亡率相关(NCT04997915)。

## Noninvasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 70 years-a prospective multicentre cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a promising alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with a particular importance amidst the shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the use of NIV in Europe and factors associated with outcomes of patients treated with NIV. 

METHODS: This is a substudy of COVIP study-an international prospective observational study enrolling patients aged ≥ 70 years with confirmed COVID-19 treated in ICU. We enrolled patients in 156 ICUs across 15 European countries between March 2020 and April 2021.The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. 

RESULTS: Cohort included 3074 patients, most of whom were male (2197/3074, 71.4%) at the mean age of 75.7 years (SD 4.6). NIV frequency was 25.7% and varied from 1.1 to 62.0% between participating countries. Primary NIV failure, defined as need for endotracheal intubation or death within 30 days since ICU admission, occurred in 470/629 (74.7%) of patients. Factors associated with increased NIV failure risk were higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR 3.73, 95% CI 2.36-5.90) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) on admission (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06-2.00). Patients initially treated with NIV (n = 630) lived for 1.36 fewer days (95% CI - 2.27 to - 0.46 days) compared to primary IMV group (n = 1876). 

CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of NIV use varies across European countries. Higher severity of illness and more severe frailty were associated with a risk of NIV failure among critically ill older adults with COVID-19. Primary IMV was associated with better outcomes than primary NIV.

##中文标题- 年龄≥70岁的COVID-19患者中的无创通气-一项前瞻性多中心队列研究

**摘要**

背景：在COVID-19大流行期间重症监护室(ICU)床位短缺的情况下，无创通气(NIV)是有前景的有创机械通气(IMV)的替代方法，具有特别重要的意义。我们旨在评估NIV在欧洲的使用情况以及与NIV治疗患者结局相关的因素。

方法：这是一项COVIP研究的子研究-一项国际前瞻性观察性研究，入组了在ICU接受治疗的年龄≥70岁的确诊COVID-19患者。2020年3月至2021年4月，我们在15个欧洲国家的156间ICU招募了患者。主要终点为30天死亡率。

结果：队列包括3074例患者，其中大多数为男性(2197/3074，71.4%)，平均年龄为75.7岁(SD 4.6)。NIV发生率为25.7%，不同参与国家之间的发生率为1.1%至62.0%。470/629(74.7%)例患者发生原发性NIV失败（定义为入住ICU后30天内需要气管插管或死亡）。NIV失败风险增加的相关因素是入院时序贯器官衰竭评估(SOFA)评分(OR 3.73，95%CI 2.36-5.90)和临床虚弱量表(CFS)评分(OR 1.46，95%CI 1.06-2.00)更高。与初始IMV组(n = 1876)相比，初始接受NIV治疗的患者(n = 630)存活天数少1.36天（95%CI-2.27至-0.46天）。

结论：欧洲国家NIV的使用频率不同。在COVID-19的老年危重患者中，疾病严重程度越高和虚弱程度越严重与NIV失败风险相关。初始IMV的结局优于初始NIV。

## Long-term cognitive functioning is impaired in ICU-treated COVID-19 patients: a comprehensive controlled neuropsychological study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment has emerged as a common post-acute sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We hypothesised that cognitive impairment exists in patients after COVID-19 and that it is most severe in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 

METHODS: This prospective controlled cohort study of 213 participants performed at the Helsinki University Hospital and the University of Helsinki, Finland, comprised three groups of patients-ICU-treated (n = 72), ward-treated (n = 49), and home-isolated (n = 44)-with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13 and December 31, 2020, participating in a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation six months after the acute phase. Our study included a control group with no history of COVID-19 (n = 48). Medical and demographic data were collected from electronic patient records and interviews carried out four months after the acute phase. Questionnaires filled six months after the acute phase provided information about change in cognitive functioning observed by a close informant, as well as the presence of self-reported depressive and post-traumatic symptoms. 

RESULTS: The groups differed (effect size η(2)(p) = 0.065, p = 0.004) in the total cognitive score, calculated from neuropsychological measures in three domains (attention, executive functions, and memory). Both ICU-treated (p = 0.011) and ward-treated patients (p = 0.005) performed worse than home-isolated patients. Among those with more than 12 years of education, ICU-treated patients performed worse in the attention domain than ward-treated patients (p = 0.021) or non-COVID controls (p = 0.045); ICU-treated male patients, in particular, were impaired in executive functions (p = 0.037). 

CONCLUSIONS: ICU-treated COVID-19 patients, compared to patients with less severe acute COVID-19 or non-COVID controls, showed more severe long-term cognitive impairment. Among those with more than 12 years of education, impairment existed particularly in the domains of attention and for men, of executive functions.

##中文标题- 在ICU治疗的COVID-19患者中长期认知功能受损：一项综合性对照神经心理学研究

**摘要**

背景：认知障碍已成为2019年冠状病毒病常见的急性后遗症(COVID-19)。我们假设COVID-19治疗后患者存在认知功能障碍，并且在入住重症监护室(ICU)的患者中最严重。

方法：这项前瞻性对照队列研究包括213名在赫尔辛基大学医院和芬兰赫尔辛基大学进行的参与者，包括3组患者-ICU治疗组(n = 72)，病房治疗组(n = 49)和家庭隔离组(n = 44)-确认COVID-19，2020年3月13日至12月31日，在急性期后6个月参加全面的神经心理学评估。我们的研究包括无COVID-19病史的对照组(n = 48)。从患者的电子记录中收集医学和人口统计学数据，并在急性期后4个月进行访谈。急性期后6个月填写的问卷提供了密切知情者观察到的认知功能变化以及自我报告的抑郁和创伤后症状的存在情况。

结果：根据3个领域（注意、执行功能和记忆）的神经心理学指标计算，各组在总认知评分方面存在差异（效应量η(2)(p)= 0.065，p = 0.004）。ICU治疗患者(p = 0.011)和病房治疗患者(p = 0.005)的表现均劣于家庭隔离患者。在接受12年以上教育的患者中，ICU治疗患者在注意领域的表现劣于病房治疗患者(p = 0.021)或非COVID对照患者(p = 0.045)；尤其是ICU治疗的男性患者执行功能受损(p = 0.037)。

结论：ICU治疗的COVID-19患者与较轻的急性COVID-19或非COVID对照患者相比，表现出更严重的长期认知障碍。在接受12年以上教育的患者中，特别是在注意领域和男性执行功能方面存在损害。

## Palliative care practice and moral distress during COVID-19 pandemic (PEOpLE-C19 study): a national, cross-sectional study in intensive care units in the Czech Republic

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Providing palliative care at the end of life (EOL) in intensive care units (ICUs) seems to be modified during the COVID-19 pandemic with potential burden of moral distress to health care providers (HCPs). We seek to assess the practice of EOL care during the COVID-19 pandemic in ICUs in the Czech Republic focusing on the level of moral distress and its possible modifiable factors. 

METHODS: Between 16 June 2021 and 16 September 2021, a national, cross-sectional study in intensive care units (ICUs) in Czech Republic was performed. All physicians and nurses working in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study. For questionnaire development ACADEMY and CHERRIES guide and checklist were used. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyse possible modifiable factors of moral distress. 

RESULTS: In total, 313 HCPs (14.5% out of all HCPs who opened the questionnaire) fully completed the survey. Results showed that 51.8% (n = 162) of respondents were exposed to moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. 63.1% (n = 113) of nurses and 71.6% of (n = 96) physicians had experience with the perception of inappropriate care. If inappropriate care was perceived, a higher chance for the occurrence of moral distress for HCPs (OR, 1.854; CI, 1.057-3.252; p = 0.0312) was found. When patients died with dignity, the chance for moral distress was lower (OR, 0.235; CI, 0.128-0.430; p < 0.001). The three most often reported differences in palliative care practice during pandemic were health system congestion, personnel factors, and characteristics of COVID-19 infection. 

CONCLUSIONS: HCPs working at ICUs experienced significant moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. The major sources were perceiving inappropriate care and dying of patients without dignity. Improvement of the decision-making process and communication at the end of life could lead to a better ethical and safety climate.

##中文标题- COVID-19流行期间的姑息治疗实践和道德困扰（PEOpLE-C19研究）：捷克共和国重症监护室的一项全国横断面研究

**摘要**

背景：在COVID-19大流行期间，在重症监护室(ICU)提供临终关怀(EOL)似乎有所改变，可能给医疗保健提供者(HCP)带来道德困扰的潜在负担。我们试图评估捷克共和国ICUs中COVID-19大流行期间EOL护理的实践，重点关注道德困扰的水平及其可能的可改变因素。

方法：在2021年6月16日至2021年9月16日期间，在捷克共和国的重症监护室(ICU)进行了一项全国性横断面研究。COVID-19大流行期间在ICU工作的所有医生和护士均被纳入研究。问卷开发使用了ACADEMY和CHERRIES指南和检查表。使用多变量logistic回归模型分析可能的道德困扰可变因素。

结果：共有313名HCP（在打开问卷的所有HCP中占14.5%）完全完成了调查。结果显示，51.8%(n = 162)的受访者在COVID-19大流行期间暴露于道德困扰。63.1%(n = 113)的护士和71.6%(n = 96)的医生有护理不当的感觉。如果认为护理不当，则发现HCP发生精神抑郁的几率更高(OR，1.854；CI，1.057-3.252；p = 0.0312)。当患者有尊严地死亡时，发生道德困扰的几率较低(OR，0.235；CI，0.128-0.430；p < 0.001)。大流行期间姑息治疗实践中最常报告的3个差异是卫生系统充血、人员因素和COVID-19感染的特征。

结论：在捷克共和国COVID-19大流行期间，在ICU工作的HCP经历了显著的道德困扰。主要来源是认为护理不当和患者无尊严死亡。在临终阶段改进决策过程和沟通可改善伦理和安全环境。

## Feasibility and discriminatory value of tissue motion annular displacement in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: a single-center retrospective observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: There is no formal diagnostic criterion for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM), but left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% was the most commonly used standard. Tissue motion annular displacement (TMAD) is a novel speckle tracking indicator to quickly assess LV longitudinal systolic function. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and discriminatory value of TMAD for predicting SICM, as well as prognostic value of TMAD for mortality. 

METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective observational study in patients with sepsis or septic shock who underwent echocardiography examination within the first 24 h after admission. Basic clinical information and conventional echocardiographic data, including mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE), were collected. Based on speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), global longitudinal strain (GLS) and TMAD were, respectively, performed offline. The parameters acquisition rate, inter- and intra-observer reliability, time consumed for measurement were assessed for the feasibility analysis. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) values were calculated to assess the discriminatory value of TMAD/GLS/MAPSE for predicting SICM, defined as LVEF < 50%. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was performed according to the cutoff values in predicting SICM. Cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine the risk factors for 28d and in-hospital mortality. 

RESULTS: A total of 143 patients were enrolled in this study. Compared with LVEF, GLS or MAPSE, TMAD exhibited the highest parameter acquisition rate, intra- and inter-observer reliability. The mean time for offline analyses with TMAD was significantly shorter than that with LVEF or GLS (p < 0.05). According to the AUROC analysis, TMADMid presented an excellent discriminatory value for predicting SICM (AUROC > 0.9). Patients with lower TMADMid (< 9.75 mm) had significantly higher 28d and in-hospital mortality (both p < 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that BMI and SOFA were the independent risk factors for 28d and in-hospital mortality in sepsis cases, but TMAD was not. 

CONCLUSION: STE-based TMAD is a novel and feasible technology with promising discriminatory value for predicting SICM with LVEF < 50%.

##中文标题- 脓毒症心肌病组织运动环移位的可行性和鉴别价值：单中心回顾性观察研究

**摘要**

背景：目前尚无败血症诱导的心肌病(SICM)的正式诊断标准，但左心室射血分数(LVEF)< 50%是最常用的标准。组织运动瓣环位移(TMAD)是一种新型的斑点追踪指标，可快速评估LV纵向收缩功能。本研究旨在评估TMAD预测SICM的可行性和区分价值，以及TMAD对死亡率的预后价值。

方法：我们在入院后24h内进行了超声心动图检查的败血症或感染性休克患者中进行了一项单中心回顾性观察性研究。收集基本临床信息和常规超声心动图数据，包括二尖瓣环平面收缩偏移(MAPSE)。基于斑点追踪超声心动图(STE)，分别离线进行整体纵向应变(GLS)和TMAD。评估参数采集率、观察者间和观察者内可靠性、测量耗时，用于可行性分析。计算受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUROC)值，评估TMAD/GLS/MAPSE预测SICM的鉴别值，定义为LVEF < 50%。根据预测SICM的截断值进行Kaplan-Meier生存曲线分析。采用Cox比例风险模型确定28d和住院期间死亡的危险因素。

结果：本研究共入组143例患者。与LVEF、GLS或MAPSE相比，TMAD表现出最高的参数采集率、观察者内和观察者间可靠性。TMAD离线分析的平均时间显著短于LVEF或GLS(p < 0.05)。根据AUROC分析，TMADMid对于预测SICM呈现极好的鉴别价值(AUROC > 0.9)。TMADMid较低(< 9.75 mm)的患者28天和住院期间死亡率显著较高（两者p < 0.05）。多变量Cox比例风险模型显示，BMI和SOFA是脓毒血症病例28d和住院死亡率的独立风险因素，但TMAD不是。

结论：基于st的TMAD是一种新型可行的技术，在预测LVEF < 50%的SICM方面具有很好的鉴别价值。

## Tidal volume challenge to predict preload responsiveness in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome under prone position

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Prone position is frequently used in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Our study investigated the ability of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and its changes during a tidal volume challenge (TVC) to assess preload responsiveness in ARDS patients under prone position. 

METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in a 25-bed intensive care unit at a university hospital. We included patients with ARDS under prone position, ventilated with 6 mL/kg tidal volume and monitored by a transpulmonary thermodilution device. We measured PPV and its changes during a TVC (ΔPPV TVC(6-8)) after increasing the tidal volume from 6 to 8 mL/kg for one minute. Changes in cardiac index (CI) during a Trendelenburg maneuver (ΔCI(TREND)) and during end-expiratory occlusion (EEO) at 8 mL/kg tidal volume (ΔCI EEO(8)) were recorded. Preload responsiveness was defined by both ΔCI(TREND) ≥ 8% and ΔCI EEO(8) ≥ 5%. Preload unresponsiveness was defined by both ΔCI(TREND) < 8% and ΔCI EEO(8) < 5%. 

RESULTS: Eighty-four sets of measurements were analyzed in 58 patients. Before prone positioning, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen was 104 ± 27 mmHg. At the inclusion time, patients were under prone position for 11 (2-14) hours. Norepinephrine was administered in 83% of cases with a dose of 0.25 (0.15-0.42) µg/kg/min. The positive end-expiratory pressure was 14 (11-16) cmH(2)O. The driving pressure was 12 (10-17) cmH(2)O, and the respiratory system compliance was 32 (22-40) mL/cmH(2)O. Preload responsiveness was detected in 42 cases. An absolute change in PPV ≥ 3.5% during a TVC assessed preload responsiveness with an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve of 0.94 ± 0.03 (sensitivity: 98%, specificity: 86%) better than that of baseline PPV (0.85 ± 0.05; p = 0.047). In the 56 cases where baseline PPV was inconclusive (≥ 4% and < 11%), ΔPPV TVC(6-8) ≥ 3.5% still enabled to reliably assess preload responsiveness (AUROC: 0.91 ± 0.05, sensitivity: 97%, specificity: 81%; p < 0.01 vs. baseline PPV). 

CONCLUSION: In patients with ARDS under low tidal volume ventilation during prone position, the changes in PPV during a TVC can reliably assess preload responsiveness without the need for cardiac output measurements.

##中文标题- 潮气量挑战预测俯卧位急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者前负荷反应性

**摘要**

背景：仰卧位常用于急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者，尤其是在2019年冠状病毒病大流行期间。我们的研究探讨了脉压变化(PPV)及其在潮气量挑战(TVC)过程中的变化评估俯卧位ARDS患者前负荷反应性的能力。

方法：这是一项在大学医院的25张病床的重症监护室中进行的前瞻性研究。我们纳入了俯卧位ARDS患者，以6 mL/kg潮气量通气，并使用经肺热稀释装置监测。我们测量了潮气量从6 mL/kg增加至8 mL/kg 1分钟后TVC期间的PPV及其变化(ΔPPV TVC(6-8))。记录了在特伦德伦伯格动作(ΔCI(TREND))和以8 mL/kg潮气量呼气末阻断(EEO)(ΔCI EEO(8))期间的心脏指数(CI)变化。前负荷反应性定义为ΔCI(TREND)≥8%和ΔCI EEO(8)≥5%。将前负荷无应答定义为ΔCI(TREND)< 8%和ΔCI EEO(8)< 5%。

结果：在58例患者中分析了84组测量值。在俯卧位前，动脉血氧分压与吸入气中的氧气分数的比值为104±27 mmHg。入组时，患者处于俯卧位11(2-14)小时。83%的病例接受了去甲肾上腺素给药，剂量为0.25(0.15-0.42)µg/kg/min。呼气末正压为14(11-16)cmh2 O，驱动压力为12(10-17)cmh2 O，呼吸系统顺应性为32(22-40)mL/cmh2 O，42例检测到前负荷反应性。TVC期间PPV的绝对变化≥3.5%评估了前负荷反应性，受试者工作特征(AUROC)曲线下面积为0.94±0.03（灵敏度：98%，特异性：86%），优于基线PPV(0.85±0.05；p = 0.047)。在基线PPV不确定（≥4%和 < 11%）的56例病例中，ΔPPV TVC(6-8)≥3.5%仍能够可靠地评估前负荷反应性（AUROC：0.91±0.05，灵敏度：97%，特异性：81%；与基线PPV相比p < 0.01）。

结论：在俯卧位低潮气量通气ARDS患者中，TVC期间PPV的变化可以可靠地评估前负荷反应性，而不需要心输出量测量。

## Improving the intensive care experience from the perspectives of different stakeholders

**Abstract**

The intensive care unit (ICU) is a complex environment where patients, family members and healthcare professionals have their own personal experiences. Improving ICU experiences necessitates the involvement of all stakeholders. This holistic approach will invariably improve the care of ICU survivors, increase family satisfaction and staff wellbeing, and contribute to dignified end-of-life care. Inclusive and transparent participation of the industry can be a significant addition to develop tools and strategies for delivering this holistic care. We present a report, which follows a round table on ICU experience at the annual congress of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The aim is to discuss the current evidence on patient, family and healthcare professional experience in ICU is provided, together with the panel's suggestions on potential improvements. Combined with industry, the perspectives of all stakeholders suggest that ongoing improvement of ICU experience is warranted.

## Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 in critically ill patients: results of the prospective multicenter registry PANDEMIC

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Neurologic manifestations are increasingly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, data on prevalence, predictors and relevance for outcome of neurological manifestations in patients requiring intensive care are scarce. We aimed to characterize prevalence, risk factors and impact on outcome of neurologic manifestations in critically ill COVID-19 patients. 

METHODS: In the prospective, multicenter, observational registry study PANDEMIC (Pooled Analysis of Neurologic DisordErs Manifesting in Intensive care of COVID-19), we enrolled COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations admitted to 19 German intensive care units (ICU) between April 2020 and September 2021. We performed descriptive and explorative statistical analyses. Multivariable models were used to investigate factors associated with disorder categories and their underlying diagnoses as well as to identify predictors of outcome. 

RESULTS: Of the 392 patients included in the analysis, 70.7% (277/392) were male and the mean age was 65.3 (SD ± 3.1) years. During the study period, a total of 2681 patients with COVID-19 were treated at the ICUs of 15 participating centers. New neurologic disorders were identified in 350 patients, reported by these centers, suggesting a prevalence of COVID-19-associated neurologic disorders of 12.7% among COVID-19 ICU patients. Encephalopathy (46.2%; 181/392), cerebrovascular (41.0%; 161/392) and neuromuscular disorders (20.4%; 80/392) were the most frequent categories identified. Out of 35 cerebrospinal fluid analyses with reverse transcriptase PCR for SARS-COV-2, only 3 were positive. In-hospital mortality was 36.0% (140/389), and functional outcome (mRS 3 to 5) of surviving patients was poor at hospital discharge in 70.9% (161/227). Intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.5-14.9, p < 0.001) and acute ischemic stroke (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.9-8.2, p < 0.001) were the strongest predictors of poor outcome among the included patients. 

CONCLUSIONS: Based on this well-characterized COVID-19 ICU cohort, that comprised 12.7% of all severe ill COVID-19 patients, neurologic manifestations increase mortality and morbidity. Since no reliable evidence of direct viral affection of the nervous system by COVID-19 could be found, these neurologic manifestations may for a great part be indirect para- or postinfectious sequelae of the infection or severe critical illness. Neurologic ICU complications should be actively searched for and treated.

##中文标题- 危重患者中COVID-19的神经系统表现：前瞻性多中心登记研究PANDEMIC的结果

**摘要**

背景：2019年，越来越多的冠状病毒病患者报告了神经系统表现(COVID-19)。然而，在需要重症监护的患者中，关于患病率、预测因素和神经病学表现结局相关性的数据很少。我们旨在描述COVID-19重症患者神经系统表现的患病率、风险因素和对结局的影响。

方法：在前瞻性、多中心、观察性注册研究PANDEMIC（COVID-19重症监护中神经系统疾病表现的汇总分析）中，我们入选了2020年4月至2021年9月期间入住19家德国重症监护室(ICU)的具有神经系统表现的COVID-19患者。我们进行了描述性和探索性统计分析。多变量模型用于研究与疾病类别及其基础诊断相关的因素，并确定结局的预测因素。

结果：纳入分析的392例患者中，70.7%(277/392)为男性，平均年龄为65.3(SD±3.1)岁。研究期间，共2681例COVID-19患者在15家参与中心的ICU接受治疗。这些中心报告350例患者出现新的神经系统疾病，表明COVID-19 ICU患者中COVID-19相关神经系统疾病的患病率为12.7%。脑病(46.2%；181/392)、脑血管(41.0%；161/392)和神经肌肉疾病(20.4%；80/392)是最常见的分类。在使用逆转录酶PCR进行的35份SARS-COV-2脑脊液分析中，仅3份为阳性。住院死亡率为36.0%(140/389)，70.9%(161/227)的存活患者出院时功能结局(mRS 3-5)较差。在纳入的患者中，脑出血(OR 6.2，95%CI 2.5-14.9，p < 0.001)和急性缺血性卒中(OR 3.9，95%CI 1.9-8.2，p < 0.001)是结局不良的最强预测因子。

结论：根据这一良好描述的COVID-19 ICU队列（占所有COVID-19重症患者的12.7%），神经病学表现增加了死亡率和发病率。由于没有可靠的证据表明神经系统受到COVID-19的直接病毒感染，这些神经系统表现在很大程度上可能是感染或严重危重症的间接感染后或感染后后遗症。应积极寻找并治疗神经系统ICU并发症。

## The ABCDE approach to difficult weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

**Abstract**

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) has been increasingly applied in patients with cardiogenic shock in recent years. Nevertheless, many patients cannot be successfully weaned from VA ECMO support and 1-year mortality remains high. A systematic approach could help to optimize clinical management in favor of weaning by identifying important factors in individual patients. Here, we provide an overview of pivotal factors that potentially prevent successful weaning of VA ECMO. We present this through a rigorous approach following the relatable acronym ABCDE, in order to facilitate widespread use in daily practice.

## External validation of a machine learning model to predict hemodynamic instability in intensive care unit

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Early prediction model of hemodynamic instability has the potential to improve the critical care, whereas limited external validation on the generalizability. We aimed to independently validate the Hemodynamic Stability Index (HSI), a multi-parameter machine learning model, in predicting hemodynamic instability in Asian patients. 

METHOD: Hemodynamic instability was marked by using inotropic, vasopressor, significant fluid therapy, and/or blood transfusions. This retrospective study included among 15,967 ICU patients who aged 20 years or older (not included 20 years) and stayed in ICU for more than 6 h admitted to Taipei Veteran General Hospital (TPEVGH) between January 1, 2010, and March 31, 2020, of whom hemodynamic instability occurred in 3053 patients (prevalence = 19%). These patients in unstable group received at least one intervention during their ICU stays, and the HSI score of both stable and unstable group was calculated in every hour before intervention. The model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and was compared to single indicators like systolic blood pressure (SBP) and shock index. The hemodynamic instability alarm was set by selecting optimal threshold with high sensitivity, acceptable specificity, and lead time before intervention was calculated to indicate when patients were firstly identified as high risk of hemodynamic instability. 

RESULTS: The AUROC of HSI was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75-0.77), which performed significantly better than shock Index (0.7; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71) and SBP (0.69; 95% CI, 0.68-0.70). By selecting 0.7 as a threshold, HSI predicted 72% of all 3053 patients who received hemodynamic interventions with 67% in specificity. Time-varying results also showed that HSI score significantly outperformed single indicators even up to 24 h before intervention. And 95% unstable patients can be identified more than 5 h in advance. 

CONCLUSIONS: The HSI has acceptable discrimination but underestimates the risk of stable patients in predicting the onset of hemodynamic instability in an external cohort.

##中文标题- 机器学习模型预测重症监护室血流动力学不稳定的外部验证

**摘要**

背景：血流动力学不稳定的早期预测模型有可能改善重症监护，而关于普遍性的外部验证有限。我们旨在独立验证血流动力学稳定性指数(HSI)，一种多参数机器学习模型，用于预测亚洲患者的血流动力学不稳定。

方法：通过正性肌力药物、血管加压药、显著液体治疗和/或输血标记血流动力学不稳定。本回顾性研究纳入2010年1月1日至2020年3月31日在台北荣民总医院(TPEVGH)入住ICU的15967例年龄≥20岁（不包括20岁）且在ICU住院超过6h的患者，其中3053例患者发生血流动力学不稳定（患病率 = 19%）。不稳定组患者在ICU住院期间至少接受1次干预，干预前每小时计算稳定组和不稳定组的HSI评分。使用受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUROC)评估模型性能，并与收缩压(SBP)和休克指数等单一指标进行比较。通过选择敏感性高、特异性可接受的最佳阈值来设置血流动力学不稳定报警，并计算介入前的导联时间，以表明患者首次被确定为血流动力学不稳定的高风险。

结果：HSI的AUROC为0.76(95%CI，0.75-0.77)，显著优于休克指数(0.7；95%CI，0.69-0.71)和SBP(0.69；95%CI，0.68-0.70)。通过选择0.7作为阈值，HSI预测所有3053例接受血流动力学干预的患者中有72%的患者特异性为67%。时变结果也表明，即使在干预前24h，HSI评分也显著优于单项指标。95%的不稳定患者可提前超过5h确认。

结论：HSI具有可接受的区分度，但在预测外部队列中血液动力学不稳定发作时低估了稳定患者的风险。

## The gut-liver axis in sepsis: interaction mechanisms and therapeutic potential

**Abstract**

Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by dysregulation of the body's immune response to an infection. Sepsis-induced liver injury is considered a strong independent prognosticator of death in the critical care unit, and there is anatomic and accumulating epidemiologic evidence that demonstrates intimate cross talk between the gut and the liver. Intestinal barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis during sepsis result in translocation of intestinal pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver and systemic circulation. The liver is essential for regulating immune defense during systemic infections via mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, lipopolysaccharide detoxification, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and inflammation metabolic regulation. When an inappropriate immune response or overwhelming inflammation occurs in the liver, the impaired capacity for pathogen clearance and hepatic metabolic disturbance can result in further impairment of the intestinal barrier and increased disruption of the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, interaction between the gut and liver is a potential therapeutic target. This review outlines the intimate gut-liver cross talk (gut-liver axis) in sepsis.

##中文标题- 脓毒症的肠-肝轴：相互作用机制和治疗潜能

**摘要**

败血症是一种潜在的致死性疾病，由机体对感染的免疫应答失调引起。脓毒血症诱导的肝损伤被认为是重症监护室中强有力的独立死亡预测因子，并且有解剖学和累积流行病学证据表明肠道和肝脏之间存在密切的交叉作用。脓毒血症期间肠道屏障破坏和肠道菌群微生态失调导致肠道病原体相关分子模式和损伤相关分子模式易位至肝脏和体循环。在全身感染过程中，肝脏对通过细菌清除、脂多糖解毒、细胞因子和急性期蛋白释放以及炎症代谢调节等机制调节免疫防御至关重要。当肝脏发生不适当的免疫应答或爆发性炎症时，病原体清除能力受损和肝脏代谢紊乱可导致肠道屏障进一步受损，肠道菌群的组成和多样性受到破坏。因此，肠道与肝脏之间的相互作用是一个潜在的治疗靶点。这篇综述概述了脓毒症中密切的肠-肝相声（肠-肝轴）。

## Oxygenation versus driving pressure for determining the best positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome

**Abstract**

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare driving pressure and absolute PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in determining the best positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level. PATIENTS AND 

METHODS: In 122 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, PEEP was increased until plateau pressure reached 30 cmH(2)O at constant tidal volume, then decreased at 15-min intervals, to 15, 10, and 5 cmH(2)O. The best PEEP by PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (PEEP(O2)) was defined as the highest PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio obtained, and the best PEEP by driving pressure (PEEP(DP)) as the lowest driving pressure. The difference between the best PEEP levels was compared to a non-inferiority margin of 1.5 cmH(2)O. MAIN 

RESULTS: The best mean PEEP(O2) value was 11.9 ± 4.7 cmH(2)O compared to 10.6 ± 4.1 cmH(2)O for the best PEEP(DP): mean difference = 1.3 cmH(2)O (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.4-2.3; one-tailed P value, 0.36). Only 46 PEEP levels were the same with the two methods (37.7%; 95% CI 29.6-46.5). PEEP level was ≥ 15 cmH(2)O in 61 (50%) patients with PEEP(O2) and 39 (32%) patients with PEEP(DP) (P = 0.001). 

CONCLUSION: Depending on the method chosen, the best PEEP level varies. The best PEEP(DP) level is lower than the best PEEP(O2) level. Computing driving pressure is simple, faster and less invasive than measuring PaO(2). However, our results do not demonstrate that one method deserves preference over the other in terms of patient outcome. CLINICAL

##中文标题- 比较氧合与驱动压力确定急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者的最佳呼气末正压

**摘要**

目的：本前瞻性纵向研究旨在比较驱动压力和绝对PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值确定最佳呼气末正压(PEEP)水平。患者和

方法：122例急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者，在恒定潮气量下，增加PEEP直至平台压达到30 cmh2 O，然后间隔15 min下降至15、10和5 cmh2 O。最佳PEEP的pao2/fio2比值(PEEP(O2))定义为获得的最高pao2/fio2比值，最佳PEEP由驱动压力(PEEP(DP))作为最低驱动压力。最佳PEEP水平之间的差异与非劣效性界值1.5 cmH(2)O相比。MAIN

结果：最佳平均PEEP(O2)值为11.9±4.7 cmh2 O，最佳PEEP(DP)值为10.6±4.1 cmh2 O：平均差 = 1.3 cmh2 O（95%置信区间[95%CI]，0.4-2.3；单侧P值，0.36）。两种方法只有46个PEEP水平相同(37.7%；95%CI 29.6-46.5)。61例(50%)PEEP(O2)患者和39例(32%)PEEP(DP)患者的PEEP水平≥15 cmh2(2)O(P = 0.001)。

结论：根据选择的方法，最佳PEEP水平不同。最佳PEEP(DP)水平低于最佳PEEP(O2)水平。相较于测量PaO(2)，计算驱动压力简单、快速且侵入性较小。但是，我们的结果没有显示一种方法在患者结局方面优于另一种方法。临床

## Effects of PEEP on regional ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the acute respiratory distress syndrome

**Abstract**

PURPOSE: In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), decreasing Ventilation-Perfusion [Formula: see text] mismatch might enhance lung protection. We investigated the regional effects of higher Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) on [Formula: see text] mismatch and their correlation with recruitability. We aimed to verify whether PEEP improves regional [Formula: see text] mismatch, and to study the underlying mechanisms. 

METHODS: In fifteen patients with moderate and severe ARDS, two PEEP levels (5 and 15 cmH(2)O) were applied in random order. [Formula: see text] mismatch was assessed by Electrical Impedance Tomography at each PEEP. Percentage of ventilation and perfusion reaching different ranges of [Formula: see text] ratios were analyzed in 3 gravitational lung regions, leading to precise assessment of their distribution throughout different [Formula: see text] mismatch compartments. Recruitability between the two PEEP levels was measured by the recruitment-to-inflation ratio method. 

RESULTS: In the non-dependent region, at higher PEEP, ventilation reaching the normal [Formula: see text] compartment (p = 0.018) increased, while it decreased in the high [Formula: see text] one (p = 0.023). In the middle region, at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O, ventilation and perfusion to the low [Formula: see text] compartment decreased (p = 0.006 and p = 0.011) and perfusion to normal [Formula: see text] increased (p = 0.003). In the dependent lung, the percentage of blood flowing through the non-ventilated compartment decreased (p = 0.041). Regional [Formula: see text] mismatch improvement was correlated to lung recruitability and changes in regional tidal volume. 

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARDS, higher PEEP optimizes the distribution of both ventilation (in the non-dependent areas) and perfusion (in the middle and dependent lung). Bedside measure of recruitability is associated with improved [Formula: see text] mismatch.

##中文标题- PEEP对急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者局部通气-灌注不匹配的影响

**摘要**

目的：在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)中，减少通气-灌注[公式：见文本]不匹配可能增强肺保护。我们研究了较高呼气末正压(PEEP)对[公式：见正文]不匹配的区域影响及其与招募性的相关性。我们旨在验证PEEP是否改善区域[公式：见文本]不匹配，并研究潜在机制。

方法：在15例中度和重度ARDS患者中，随机应用两种PEEP水平（5和15 cmh2）O。[公式：见正文]在每次PEEP时通过电阻抗断层成像评估不匹配。在3个重力肺区中分析了达到不同[公式：见正文]比值范围的通气和灌注百分比，从而精确评估其在不同[公式：见正文]不匹配区室中的分布。通过招募-充气比方法测量两个PEEP水平之间的招募率。

结果：在非依赖区域，PEEP较高时，达到正常[公式：见正文]隔室的通气量增加(p = 0.018)，而在高[公式：见正文]隔室的通气量减少(p = 0.023)。中间区域，PEEP 15 cmH(2)O，低[公式：见文本]隔室通气和灌注减少（p = 0.006和p = 0.011），正常灌注[公式：见文本]增加(p = 0.003)。在依赖性肺中，流经非通气室的血液百分比降低(p = 0.041)。区域[公式：见文本]不匹配改善与肺复张性和区域潮气量变化相关。

结论：在ARDS患者中，较高的PEEP优化了通气（非依赖区）和灌注（中间和依赖肺）的分布。床边招募能力测量与改善的[公式：见文本]不匹配相关。

## Integrated PERSEVERE and endothelial biomarker risk model predicts death and persistent MODS in pediatric septic shock: a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a critical driver of sepsis morbidity and mortality in children. Early identification of those at risk of death and persistent organ dysfunctions is necessary to enrich patients for future trials of sepsis therapeutics. Here, we sought to integrate endothelial and PERSEVERE biomarkers to estimate the composite risk of death or organ dysfunctions on day 7 of septic shock. 

METHODS: We measured endothelial dysfunction markers from day 1 serum among those with existing PERSEVERE data. TreeNet® classification model was derived incorporating 22 clinical and biological variables to estimate risk. Based on relative variable importance, a simplified 6-biomarker model was developed thereafter. 

RESULTS: Among 502 patients, 49 patients died before day 7 and 124 patients had persistence of MODS on day 7 of septic shock. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for the newly derived PERSEVEREnce model to predict death or day 7 MODS was 0.93 (0.91-0.95) with a summary AUROC of 0.80 (0.76-0.84) upon tenfold cross-validation. The simplified model, based on IL-8, HSP70, ICAM-1, Angpt2/Tie2, Angpt2/Angpt1, and Thrombomodulin, performed similarly. Interaction between variables-ICAM-1 with IL-8 and Thrombomodulin with Angpt2/Angpt1-contributed to the models' predictive capabilities. Model performance varied when estimating risk of individual organ dysfunctions with AUROCS ranging from 0.91 to 0.97 and 0.68 to 0.89 in training and test sets, respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS: The newly derived PERSEVEREnce biomarker model reliably estimates risk of death or persistent organ dysfunctions on day 7 of septic shock. If validated, this tool can be used for prognostic enrichment in future pediatric trials of sepsis therapeutics.

##中文标题- PERSEVERE联合内皮生物标志物风险模型可预测小儿感染性休克中的死亡和持续性MODS：一项前瞻性观察性研究的次要分析

**摘要**

背景：多器官功能障碍综合征(MODS)是儿童败血症发病和死亡的关键驱动因素。早期识别有死亡和持续器官功能障碍风险的患者对于将来败血症治疗试验富集患者是必要的。在此，我们试图整合内皮和PERSEVERE生物标志物来评估感染性休克第7天死亡或器官功能障碍的复合风险。

方法：我们在现有PERSEVERE数据的患者中从第1天血清测量了内皮功能障碍标志物。TreeNet®分类模型结合22个临床和生物学变量推导得出，用于估计风险。基于相对变量的重要性，此后开发了简化的6种生物标志物模型。

结果：502例患者中，49例患者在第7天前死亡，124例患者在脓毒性休克第7天持续存在MODS。10倍交叉验证后，新推导的PERSEVEREnce模型预测死亡或第7天MODS的受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUROC)为0.93(0.91-0.95)，汇总AUROC为0.80(0.76-0.84)。基于IL-8、HSP70、ICAM-1、Angpt2/Tie2、Angpt2/Angpt1和血栓调节蛋白的简化模型的表现相似。变量-ICAM-1与IL-8和血栓调节蛋白与Angpt2/Angpt1之间的相互作用有助于模型的预测能力。当估计个体器官功能障碍风险时，模型性能有所不同，AUROCS在训练集和测试集中的范围分别为0.91至0.97和0.68至0.89。

结论：新推导的PERSEVEREnce生物标志物模型能够可靠地估计感染性休克第7天的死亡或持续性器官功能障碍风险。如果经过验证，该工具可用于将来败血症治疗的儿科试验中的预后富集。

## Disparities in adult critical care resources across Pakistan: findings from a national survey and assessment using a novel scoring system

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerted efforts were made by provincial and federal governments to invest in critical care infrastructure and medical equipment to bridge the gap of resource-limitation in intensive care units (ICUs) across Pakistan. An initial step in creating a plan toward strengthening Pakistan's baseline critical care capacity was to carry out a needs-assessment within the country to assess gaps and devise strategies for improving the quality of critical care facilities. 

METHODS: To assess the baseline critical care capacity of Pakistan, we conducted a series of cross-sectional surveys of hospitals providing COVID-19 care across the country. These hospitals were pre-identified by the Health Services Academy (HSA), Pakistan. Surveys were administered via telephonic and on-site interviews and based on a unique checklist for assessing critical care units which was created from the Partners in Health 4S Framework, which is: Space, Staff, Stuff, and Systems. These components were scored, weighted equally, and then ranked into quartiles. 

RESULTS: A total of 106 hospitals were surveyed, with the majority being in the public sector (71.7%) and in the metropolitan setting (56.6%). We found infrastructure, staffing, and systems lacking as only 19.8% of hospitals had negative pressure rooms and 44.4% had quarantine facilities for staff. Merely 36.8% of hospitals employed accredited intensivists and 54.8% of hospitals maintained an ideal nurse-to-patient ratio. 31.1% of hospitals did not have a staffing model, while 37.7% of hospitals did not have surge policies. On Chi-square analysis, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between public and private sectors along with metropolitan versus rural settings in various elements. Almost all ranks showed significant disparity between public-private and metropolitan-rural settings, with private and metropolitan hospitals having a greater proportion in the 1st rank, while public and rural hospitals had a greater proportion in the lower ranks. 

CONCLUSION: Pakistan has an underdeveloped critical care network with significant inequity between public-private and metropolitan-rural strata. We hope for future resource allocation and capacity development projects for critical care in order to reduce these disparities.

##中文标题- 巴基斯坦成人重症监护资源的差异：一项采用新型评分系统的全国调查和评估的结果

**摘要**

背景：针对COVID-19大流行，各省和联邦政府一致努力投资重症监护基础设施和医疗设备，以填补整个巴基斯坦重症监护室(ICU)的资源限制缺口。制定加强巴基斯坦基础重症监护能力计划的第一步是在国内进行需求评估，以评估差距并制定改善重症监护设施质量的策略。

方法：为了评估巴基斯坦的基线重症监护能力，我们对全国提供COVID-19治疗的医院进行了一系列横断面调查。这些医院由巴基斯坦卫生服务学院(HSA)预先确定。通过电话和现场访谈进行调查，并根据独特的检查表对由Partners in Health 4S框架创建的重症监护病房进行评估，该框架包括：空间、工作人员、物品和系统。对这些组分进行评分、相等加权，然后按四分位数排列。

结果：共调查了106家医院，大多数在公共部门(71.7%)和大都市(56.6%)。我们发现缺乏基础设施、人员配备和系统，因为只有19.8%的医院有负压室，44.4%的医院有工作人员隔离设施。仅有36.8%的医院聘用认证的重症监护医生，54.8%的医院保持理想的护士-患者比率。31.1%的医院没有人员配备模式，而37.7%的医院没有激增政策。在卡方分析中，发现公立与私立部门以及大都市与乡村环境在各方面存在统计学显著差异(p < 0.05)。公立-私立和大都市-农村环境之间几乎所有等级均显示出显著差异，私立和大都市医院在第一级中的比例较大，而公立和乡村医院在较低等级中的比例较大。

结论：巴基斯坦的重症监护网络不发达，公立-私立和大都市-乡村分层存在明显不公平。我们希望未来的重症监护资源分配和能力开发项目能够减少这些差异。

## Extended prone positioning duration for COVID-19-related ARDS: benefits and detriments

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many more patients were turned prone than before, resulting in a considerable increase in workload. Whether extending duration of prone position may be beneficial has received little attention. We report here benefits and detriments of a strategy of extended prone positioning duration for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

METHODS: A eetrospective, monocentric, study was performed on intensive care unit patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who required tracheal intubation and who have been treated with at least one session of prone position of duration greater or equal to 24 h. When prone positioning sessions were initiated, patients were kept prone for a period that covered two nights. Data regarding the incidence of pressure injury and ventilation parameters were collected retrospectively on medical and nurse files of charts. The primary outcome was the occurrence of pressure injury of stage ≥ II during the ICU stay. 

RESULTS: For the 81 patients included, the median duration of prone positioning sessions was 39 h [interquartile range (IQR) 34-42]. The cumulated incidence of stage ≥ II pressure injuries was 26% [95% CI 17-37] and 2.5% [95% CI 0.3-8.8] for stages III/IV pressure injuries. Patients were submitted to a median of 2 sessions [IQR 1-4] and for 213 (94%) prone positioning sessions, patients were turned over to supine position during daytime, i.e., between 9 AM and 6 PM. This increased duration was associated with additional increase in oxygenation after 16 h with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increasing from 150 mmHg [IQR 121-196] at H+ 16 to 162 mmHg [IQR 124-221] before being turned back to supine (p = 0.017). 

CONCLUSION: In patients with extended duration of prone position up to 39 h, cumulative incidence for stage ≥ II pressure injuries was 26%, with 25%, 2.5%, and 0% for stage II, III, and IV, respectively. Oxygenation continued to increase significantly beyond the standard 16-h duration. Our results may have significant impact on intensive care unit staffing and patients' respiratory conditions.

##中文标题- COVID-19相关ARDS的扩展俯卧位持续时间：获益和危害

**摘要**

背景：在COVID-19大流行期间，比以前更多的患者变得倾向，导致工作量相当大。延长俯卧位持续时间是否有益尚未引起关注。我们报告了延长COVID-19相关急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)俯卧位持续时间策略的益处与危害。

方法：在需要气管插管且至少接受一次持续时间≥24 h俯卧位治疗的COVID-19相关ARDS重症监护室患者中进行了一项回顾性、单中心研究。患者保持俯卧位，持续2晚。在病历的医疗和护士档案中回顾性收集了关于压力性损伤发生率和通气参数的数据。主要结局是在ICU住院期间发生≥II期的压力性损伤。

结果：对于纳入的81例患者，俯卧位疗程的中位持续时间为39h[四分位距(IQR)34-42h]。≥II期压力损伤的累积发生率为26%[95%CI 17-37]，III/IV期压力损伤为2.5%[95%CI 0.3-8.8]。患者接受治疗的中位次数为2次[IQR 1-4]，213次(94%)俯卧位治疗的患者在日间（即上午9点至下午6点）转为仰卧位。持续时间的增加与16h后氧合作用的进一步增加相关，PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值从h + 16时的150 mmHg[IQR 121-196]增至恢复仰卧位前的162 mmHg[IQR 124-221](p = 0.017)。

结论：在俯卧位持续时间延长至39 h的患者中，≥II期压力损伤的累积发生率为26%，II、III和IV期分别为25%、2.5%和0%。氧合持续显著增加，超过标准16h持续时间。我们的结果可能对重症监护室人员配备和患者的呼吸系统疾病具有显著影响。

## Development and validation of a multivariable prediction model of central venous catheter-tip colonization in a cohort of five randomized trials

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The majority of central venous catheters (CVC) removed in the ICU are not colonized, including when a catheter-related infection (CRI) is suspected. We developed and validated a predictive score to reduce unnecessary CVC removal. 

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from five multicenter randomized controlled trials with systematic catheter-tip culture of consecutive CVCs. Colonization was defined as growth of ≥10(3) colony-forming units per mL. Risk factors for colonization were identified in the training cohort (CATHEDIA and 3SITES trials; 3899 CVCs of which 575 (15%) were colonized) through multivariable analyses. After internal validation in 500 bootstrapped samples, the CVC-OUT score was computed by attaching points to the robust (> 50% of the bootstraps) risk factors. External validation was performed in the testing cohort (CLEAN, DRESSING2 and ELVIS trials; 6848 CVCs, of which 588 (9%) were colonized). 

RESULTS: In the training cohort, obesity (1 point), diabetes (1 point), type of CVC (dialysis catheter, 1 point), anatomical insertion site (jugular, 4 points; femoral 5 points), rank of the catheter (second or subsequent, 1 point) and catheterization duration (≥ 5 days, 2 points) were significantly and independently associated with colonization . Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the CVC-OUT score was 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.67-0.72]. In the testing cohort, AUC for the CVC-OUT score was 0.60, 95% CI [0.58-0.62]. Among 1,469 CVCs removed for suspected CRI in the overall population, 1200 (82%) were not colonized. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a CVC-OUT score < 6 points was 94%, 95% CI [93%-95%]. 

CONCLUSION: The CVC-OUT score had a moderate ability to discriminate catheter-tip colonization, but the high NPV may contribute to reduce unnecessary CVCs removal. Preference of the subclavian site is the strongest and only modifiable risk factor that reduces the likelihood of catheter-tip colonization and consequently the risk of CRI.

方法：我们从5项多中心随机对照试验中进行了一项回顾性队列研究，对连续CVCs进行了系统性导管尖端培养。定植定义为每毫升生长≥10(3)个菌落形成单位。在培训队列（CATHEDIA和3SITES试验；3899例cv，其中575例(15%)定植）中通过多变量分析确定了定植的风险因素。在500个拔靴样本中进行内部验证后，通过将评分附加到稳健（> 50%的拔靴）风险因素上，计算CVC-OUT评分。在检验队列（CLEAN、DRESSING2和ELVIS试验；6848例cv，其中588例(9%)定植）中进行了外部验证。

结果：在培训队列中，肥胖（1分），糖尿病（1分），CVC类型（透析导管，1分），解剖插入部位（颈静脉，4分；股静脉，5分），导管等级（第二或更高，1分）和导管插入持续时间（≥5天，2分）与定植显著独立相关。CVC-OUT评分的ROC曲线下面积(AUC)为0.69，95%置信区间(CI)[0.67-0.72]。在检验队列中，CVC-OUT评分的AUC为0.60，95%CI[0.58-0.62]。在总体人群中，1469例因疑似CRI而移除的CVC中，1200例(82%)未定植。CVC-OUT评分 < 6分的阴性预测值(NPV)为94%，95%CI[93%-95%]。

结论：CVC-OUT评分区分导管尖端定植的能力中等，但高NPV可能有助于减少不必要的CVCs移除。锁骨下部位偏好是最强和唯一可改变的风险因素，降低了导管尖端定植的可能性，从而降低了CRI的风险。

## Comparison of diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury in critically ill children: a multicenter cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Substantial interstudy heterogeneity exists in defining acute kidney injury (AKI) and baseline serum creatinine (SCr). This study assessed AKI incidence and its association with pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality under different AKI and baseline SCr definitions to determine the preferable approach for diagnosing pediatric AKI. 

METHODS: In this multicenter prospective observational cohort study, AKI was defined and staged according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO), modified KDIGO, and pediatric reference change value optimized for AKI (pROCK) definitions. The baseline SCr was calculated based on the Schwartz formula or estimated as the upper normative value (NormsMax), admission SCr (AdmSCr) and modified AdmSCr. The impacts of different AKI definitions and baseline SCr estimation methods on AKI incidence, severity distribution and AKI outcome were evaluated. 

RESULTS: Different AKI definitions and baseline SCr estimates led to differences in AKI incidence, from 6.8 to 25.7%; patients with AKI across all definitions had higher PICU mortality ranged from 19.0 to 35.4%. A higher AKI incidence (25.7%) but lower mortality (19.0%) was observed based on the Schwartz according to the KDIGO definition, which however was overcome by modified KDIGO (AKI incidence: 16.3%, PICU mortality: 26.1%). Furthermore, for the modified KDIGO, the consistencies of AKI stages between different baseline SCr estimation methods were all strong with the concordance rates > 90.0% and weighted kappa values > 0.8, and PICU mortality increased pursuant to staging based on the Schwartz. When the NormsMax was used, the KDIGO and modified KDIGO led to an identical AKI incidence (13.6%), but PICU mortality did not differ among AKI stages. For the pROCK, PICU mortality did not increase pursuant to staging and AKI stage 3 was not associated with mortality after adjustment for confounders. 

CONCLUSIONS: The AKI incidence and staging vary depending on the definition and baseline SCr estimation method used. The modified KDIGO definition based on the Schwartz method leads AKI to be highly relevant to PICU mortality, suggesting that it may be the preferable approach for diagnosing AKI in critically ill children and provides promise for improving clinicians' ability to diagnose pediatric AKI.

##中文标题- 重症儿童急性肾损伤诊断标准的比较：多中心队列研究

**摘要**

背景：在定义急性肾损伤(AKI)和基线血清肌酐(SCr)方面存在显著的研究间异质性。本研究评估了在不同的AKI和基线SCr定义下，AKI的发生率及其与儿科重症监护室(PICU)死亡率的相关性，以确定诊断儿科AKI的首选方法。

方法：在本项多中心前瞻性观察性队列研究中，根据肾脏疾病：改善全球预后组织(KDIGO)、改良KDIGO和根据AKI优化的儿科参考变化值(pROCK)定义对AKI进行定义和分期。基线SCr根据Schwartz公式计算或估计为正常值上限(NormsMax)、入院SCr(AdmSCr)和改良AdmSCr。评价不同AKI定义和基线SCr估计方法对AKI发生率、严重程度分布和AKI结局的影响。

结果：AKI定义和基线SCr估计值不同导致AKI发生率不同，介于6.8-25.7%之间；所有定义的AKI患者PICU死亡率较高，介于19.0-35.4%之间。根据KDIGO定义，基于Schwartz，观察到较高的AKI发生率(25.7%)，但较低的死亡率(19.0%)，但改良KDIGO克服了这一定义（AKI发生率：16.3%，PICU死亡率：26.1%）。此外，对于改良KDIGO，不同基线SCr估计方法之间AKI分期的一致性均较强，一致率 > 90.0%，加权kappa值 > 0.8，根据Schwartz的分期，PICU死亡率增加。使用NormsMax时，KDIGO和改良KDIGO导致相同的AKI发生率(13.6%)，但不同AKI分期的PICU死亡率无差异。对于pROCK，根据分期，PICU死亡率未增加，校正混杂因素后，3期AKI与死亡率无关。

结论：AKI发生率和分期因采用的定义和基线SCr估计方法不同而不同。基于Schwartz法的改良KDIGO定义导致AKI与PICU病死率高度相关，提示其可能是诊断危重患儿AKI的首选方法，为提高临床医生诊断儿童AKI的能力提供了希望。

## Gasdermin-D activation by SARS-CoV-2 triggers NET and mediate COVID-19 immunopathology

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is associated with inflammation, coagulopathy, and organ damage found in severe cases of COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the release of NETs in COVID-19 remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the role of the Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pathway on NETs release and the development of organ damage during COVID-19. 

METHODS: We performed a single-cell transcriptome analysis in public data of bronchoalveolar lavage. Then, we enrolled 63 hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We analyze in blood and lung tissue samples the expression of GSDMD, presence of NETs, and signaling pathways upstreaming. Furthermore, we analyzed the treatment with disulfiram in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

RESULTS: We found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly activates the pore-forming protein GSDMD that triggers NET production and organ damage in COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of GSDMD and inflammasome-related genes were increased in COVID-19 patients. High expression of active GSDMD associated with NETs structures was found in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we showed that activation of GSDMD in neutrophils requires active caspase1/4 and live SARS-CoV-2, which infects neutrophils. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the treatment with disulfiram inhibited NETs release and reduced organ damage. 

CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that GSDMD-dependent NETosis plays a critical role in COVID-19 immunopathology and suggests GSDMD as a novel potential target for improving the COVID-19 therapeutic strategy.

##中文标题- SARS-CoV-2激活Gasdermin-D触发NET并介导COVID-19免疫病理学

**摘要**

背景：中性粒细胞胞外陷阱(NETs)的释放与COVID-19严重病例中发现的炎症、凝血病和器官损伤有关。然而，COVID-19中NETs释放的分子机制仍不清楚。目的：我们旨在研究COVID-19期间Gasdermin-D(GSDMD)通路对NETs释放和器官损伤发生的作用。

方法：我们在支气管肺泡灌洗的公开数据中进行了单细胞转录组分析。然后，我们入选了63例中度和重度COVID-19住院患者。我们分析了血液和肺组织样本中GSDMD的表达、NETs的存在和信号通路的上游。此外，我们在SARS-CoV-2感染小鼠模型中分析了双硫仑治疗。

结果：我们发现SARS-CoV-2病毒直接激活触发COVID-19中NET产生和器官损伤的造孔蛋白GSDMD。单细胞转录组分析发现COVID-19患者GSDMD和炎症小体相关基因表达增加。在COVID-19患者的肺组织中发现与NETs结构相关的活性GSDMD的高表达。此外，我们还发现中性粒细胞中GSDMD的激活需要有活性的半胱天冬酶1/4和活的SARS-CoV-2，后者可感染中性粒细胞。在SARS-CoV-2感染的小鼠模型中，双硫仑治疗抑制NETs释放并减少器官损伤。

结论：这些结果表明，GSDMD依赖性NETosis在COVID-19免疫病理学中起关键作用，并提示GSDMD是改善COVID-19治疗策略的一个新的潜在靶点。

## Intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in critical COVID-19: a multicentre propensity-weighted cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: A profound inflammation-mediated lung injury with long-term acute respiratory distress and high mortality is one of the major complications of critical COVID-19. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-enriched immunoglobulins seem especially capable of mitigating the inflicted inflammatory harm. However, the efficacy of intravenous IgM-enriched preparations in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is largely unclear. 

METHODS: In this retrospective multicentric cohort study, 316 patients with laboratory-confirmed critical COVID-19 were treated in ten German and Austrian ICUs between May 2020 and April 2021. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Analysis was performed by Cox regression models. Covariate adjustment was performed by propensity score weighting using machine learning-based SuperLearner to overcome the selection bias due to missing randomization. In addition, a subgroup analysis focusing on different treatment regimens and patient characteristics was performed. 

RESULTS: Of the 316 ICU patients, 146 received IgM-enriched immunoglobulins and 170 cases did not, which served as controls. There was no survival difference between the two groups in terms of mortality at 30 days in the overall cohort (HR(adj): 0.83; 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.25; p = 0.374). An improved 30-day survival in patients without mechanical ventilation at the time of the immunoglobulin treatment did not reach statistical significance (HR(adj): 0.23; 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.08; p = 0.063). Also, no statistically significant difference was observed in the subgroup when a daily dose of ≥ 15 g and a duration of ≥ 3 days of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins were applied (HR(adj): 0.65; 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.03; p = 0.068). 

CONCLUSIONS: Although we cannot prove a statistically reliable effect of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins, the confidence intervals may suggest a clinically relevant effect in certain subgroups. Here, an early administration (i.e. in critically ill but not yet mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients) and a dose of ≥ 15 g for at least 3 days may confer beneficial effects without concerning safety issues. However, these findings need to be validated in upcoming randomized clinical trials.

##中文标题- 关键COVID-19中静脉注射IgM富集免疫球蛋白：一项多中心倾向加权队列研究

**摘要**

背景：严重的炎症介导的肺损伤伴有长期急性呼吸窘迫和高死亡率是危重COVID-19的主要并发症之一。免疫球蛋白M(IgM)富集的免疫球蛋白似乎特别能够减轻造成的炎症损害。但是，静脉内富集IgM制剂在COVID-19重症患者中的疗效在很大程度上尚不清楚。

方法：在这项回顾性多中心队列研究中，316例实验室证实的危重COVID-19患者于2020年5月至2021年4月在10间德国和奥地利ICU接受治疗。主要结局为30天死亡率。采用Cox回归模型进行分析。使用基于机器学习的SuperLearner通过倾向评分加权进行协变量调整，以克服由于缺失随机化导致的选择偏倚。此外，还进行了针对不同治疗方案和患者特征的亚组分析。

结果：316例ICU患者中，146例接受了IgM富集的免疫球蛋白，170例未接受，作为对照。在总体队列中，第30天死亡率方面，两组之间没有生存差异(HR(adj)：0.83；95%CI：0.55-1.25；p = 0.374)。免疫球蛋白治疗时，无机械通气患者的30天生存率改善未达到统计学显著性(HR(adj)：0.23；95%CI：0.05-1.08；p = 0.063)。此外，当应用每日剂量≥15g和持续时间≥3天的IgM富集免疫球蛋白时，亚组中未观察到统计学显著性差异(HR(adj)：0.65；95%CI：0.41-1.03；p = 0.068)。

结论：虽然我们不能证明静脉内富集IgM的免疫球蛋白有统计学上可靠的作用，但置信区间可能表明在某些亚组有临床相关的作用。在此，早期给药（在尚未接受机械通气的危重COVID-19患者中），以≥15g的剂量给药至少3天可能产生有益作用，而不涉及安全性问题。然而，这些结果需要在即将进行的随机临床试验中进行验证。

## Extravascular lung water levels are associated with mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of extravascular lung water (EVLW) measured by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) in critically ill patients is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the effects of TPTD-estimated EVLW on mortality in critically ill patients. 

METHODS: Cohort studies published in English from Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1960 to 1 June 2021 were systematically searched. From eligible studies, the values of the odds ratio (OR) of EVLW as a risk factor for mortality, and the value of EVLW in survivors and non-survivors were extracted. Pooled OR were calculated from available studies. Mean differences and standard deviation of the EVLW between survivors and non-survivors were calculated. A random effects model was computed on the weighted mean differences across the two groups to estimate the pooled size effect. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity. 

RESULTS: Of the 18 studies included (1296 patients), OR could be extracted from 11 studies including 905 patients (464 survivors vs. 441 non-survivors), and 17 studies reported EVLW values of survivors and non-survivors, including 1246 patients (680 survivors vs. 566 non-survivors). The pooled OR of EVLW for mortality from eleven studies was 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) [1.22; 2.34], p < 0.0015). EVLW was significantly lower in survivors than non-survivors, with a mean difference of  -4.97 mL/kg (95% CI [-6.54; -3.41], p < 0.001). The results regarding OR and mean differences were consistent in subgroup analyses. 

CONCLUSIONS: The value of EVLW measured by TPTD is associated with mortality in critically ill patients and is significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. This finding may also be interpreted as an indirect confirmation of the reliability of TPTD for estimating EVLW at the bedside. Nevertheless, our results should be considered cautiously due to the high risk of bias of many studies included in the meta-analysis and the low rating of certainty of evidence.

##中文标题- 血管外肺水水平与死亡率相关：一项系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：经肺热稀释法(TPTD)测量的血管外肺水(EVLW)对重症患者的预后价值仍有争议。我们对评估TPTD估计的EVLW对重症患者死亡率影响的研究进行了系统综述和荟萃分析。

方法：系统检索Embase、MEDLINE和Cochrane系统评价数据库1960年至2021年6月1日以英文发表的队列研究。从合格研究中，提取了EVLW作为死亡风险因素的比值比(OR)值以及EVLW在存活者和非存活者中的值。根据现有研究计算合并OR。计算了存活者和非存活者之间EVLW的平均差异和标准差。计算两组加权平均差异的随机效应模型，估计合并大小效应。进行亚组分析以探索异质性的可能来源。

结果：在纳入的18项研究（1296例患者）中，可以从11项研究中提取OR，包括905例患者（464例存活者与441例非存活者），17项研究报告了存活者和非存活者的EVLW值，包括1246例患者（680例存活者与566例非存活者）。11项研究中EVLW死亡率的合并OR为1.69（95%置信区间(CI)[1.22；2.34]，p < 0.0015）。存活者的EVLW显著低于非存活者，平均差异为  -4.97 mL/kg(95%CI[-6.54；-3.41]，p < 0.001)。关于OR和平均差异的结果在亚组分析中一致。

结论：TPTD测量的EVLW值与重症患者的死亡率相关，非存活者显著高于存活者。这一结果也可解释为间接证实TPTD在床边估计EVLW的可靠性。然而，由于荟萃分析中纳入的许多研究存在较高的偏倚风险和较低的证据确定性评级，因此应谨慎考虑我们的结果。

## Composition and diversity analysis of the lung microbiome in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with high morbidity and health care costs, yet diagnosis remains a challenge. Analysis of airway microbiota by amplicon sequencing provides a possible solution, as pneumonia is characterised by a disruption of the microbiome. However, studies evaluating the diagnostic capabilities of microbiome analysis are limited, with a lack of alignment on possible biomarkers. Using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from ventilated adult patients suspected of VAP, we aimed to explore how key characteristics of the microbiome differ between patients with positive and negative BALF cultures and whether any differences could have a clinically relevant role. 

METHODS: BALF from patients suspected of VAP was analysed using 16s rRNA sequencing in order to: (1) differentiate between patients with and without a positive culture; (2) determine if there was any association between microbiome diversity and local inflammatory response; and (3) correctly identify pathogens detected by conventional culture. 

RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 90 ICU patients with suspected VAP had positive cultures. Patients with a positive culture had significant microbiome dysbiosis with reduced alpha diversity. However, gross compositional variance was not strongly associated with culture positivity (AUROCC range 0.66-0.71). Patients with a positive culture had a significantly higher relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria compared to those without [0.45 (IQR 0.10-0.84), 0.02 (IQR 0.004-0.09), respectively], and an increased interleukin (IL)-1β was associated with reduced species evenness (r(s) = - 0.33, p < 0.01) and increased pathogenic bacteria presence (r(s) = 0.28, p = 0.013). Untargeted 16s rRNA pathogen detection was limited by false positives, while the use of pathogen-specific relative abundance thresholds showed better diagnostic accuracy (AUROCC range 0.89-0.998). 

CONCLUSION: Patients with positive BALF culture had increased dysbiosis and genus dominance. An increased caspase-1-dependent IL-1b expression was associated with a reduced species evenness and increased pathogenic bacterial presence, providing a possible causal link between microbiome dysbiosis and lung injury development in VAP. However, measures of diversity were an unreliable predictor of culture positivity and 16s sequencing used agnostically could not usefully identify pathogens; this could be overcome if pathogen-specific relative abundance thresholds are used.

##中文标题- 疑似呼吸机相关性肺炎患者肺微生物组的组成和多样性分析

**摘要**

背景：呼吸机相关性肺炎(VAP)与高发病率和医疗保健费用相关，但诊断仍是一个挑战。通过扩增子测序分析气道菌群提供了一种可能的解决方案，因为肺炎的特征是破坏微生物组。然而，评估微生物组分析诊断能力的研究有限，缺乏可能的生物标志物的比对。使用疑似VAP的通气成人患者的支气管肺泡灌洗液(BALF)，我们旨在探索BALF培养阳性和阴性患者之间微生物组关键特征的差异，以及任何差异是否可能具有临床相关作用。

方法：使用16s rRNA测序对疑似VAP患者的BALF进行分析，以便：(1)区分有和无阳性培养物的患者；(2)确定微生物组多样性与局部炎症反应之间是否存在任何关联；(3)正确识别常规培养检出的病原体。

结果：90例疑似VAP的ICU患者中37例培养阳性。培养阳性的患者存在显著的微生物组微生态失调，α多样性降低。然而，总体组成差异与培养阳性无明显相关性（AUROCC范围0.66-0.71）。培养阳性患者的致病菌相对丰度显著高于无阳性患者[分别为0.45(IQR 0.10-0.84)，0.02(IQR 0.004-0.09)]，白细胞介素(IL)-1β升高与菌种均匀度降低相关（r(s)=-0.33，p < 0.01），致病菌增多(r(s)= 0.28，p = 0.013)。非靶向16s rRNA病原体检测受到假阳性的限制，而使用病原体特异性相对丰度阈值显示出更好的诊断准确性（AUROCC范围0.89-0.998）。

结论：BALF培养阳性的患者微生态失调增加，属优势。半胱天冬酶-1依赖性IL-1b表达的增加与菌种均匀度的降低和致病菌的增加相关，提供了VAP中微生物组微生态失调和肺损伤发生之间可能的因果联系。然而，多样性的测量是培养阳性的一个不可靠的预测因素，不可思议地使用16s测序不能有效地识别病原体；如果使用病原体特异性相对丰度阈值，这可以克服。

## Paradoxical response to chest wall loading predicts a favorable mechanical response to reduction in tidal volume or PEEP

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Chest wall loading has been shown to paradoxically improve respiratory system compliance (C(RS)) in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most likely, albeit unconfirmed, mechanism is relief of end-tidal overdistension in 'baby lungs' of low-capacity. The purpose of this study was to define how small changes of tidal volume (V(T)) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) affect C(RS) (and its associated airway pressures) in patients with ARDS who demonstrate a paradoxical response to chest wall loading. We hypothesized that small reductions of V(T) or PEEP would alleviate overdistension and favorably affect C(RS) and conversely, that small increases of V(T) or PEEP would worsen C(RS). 

METHODS: Prospective, multi-center physiologic study of seventeen patients with moderate to severe ARDS who demonstrated paradoxical responses to chest wall loading. All patients received mechanical ventilation in volume control mode and were passively ventilated. Airway pressures were measured before and after decreasing/increasing V(T) by 1 ml/kg predicted body weight and decreasing/increasing PEEP by 2.5 cmH(2)O. 

RESULTS: Decreasing either V(T) or PEEP improved C(RS) in all patients. Driving pressure (DP) decreased by a mean of 4.9 cmH(2)O (supine) and by 4.3 cmH(2)O (prone) after decreasing V(T), and by a mean of 2.9 cmH(2)O (supine) and 2.2 cmH(2)O (prone) after decreasing PEEP. C(RS) increased by a mean of 3.1 ml/cmH(2)O (supine) and by 2.5 ml/cmH(2)O (prone) after decreasing V(T.) C(RS) increased by a mean of 5.2 ml/cmH(2)O (supine) and 3.6 ml/cmH(2)O (prone) after decreasing PEEP (P < 0.01 for all). Small increments of either V(T) or PEEP worsened C(RS) in the majority of patients. 

CONCLUSION: Patients with a paradoxical response to chest wall loading demonstrate uniform improvement in both DP and C(RS) following a reduction in either V(T) or PEEP, findings in keeping with prior evidence suggesting its presence is a sign of end-tidal overdistension. The presence of 'paradox' should prompt re-evaluation of modifiable determinants of end-tidal overdistension, including V(T), PEEP, and body position.

##中文标题- 胸壁负荷的反常反应预示着对潮气量或PEEP下降的良好机械反应

**摘要**

背景：已证实胸壁负荷可反常改善中重度急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者的呼吸系统顺应性(C(RS))。尽管尚未得到证实，但最有可能的机制是缓解低容量“婴儿肺”的潮气末过度膨胀。本研究的目的是确定在胸壁负荷呈反常反应的ARDS患者中，潮气量(V(T))和呼气末正压(PEEP)的微小变化如何影响C(RS)（及其相关的气道压力）。我们假设，V(T)或PEEP的小幅降低可缓解过度膨胀，对C(RS)产生有利影响，相反，V(T)或PEEP的小幅升高可使C(RS)恶化。

方法：对17例中重度ARDS患者进行前瞻性、多中心生理学研究，这些患者对胸壁负荷表现出反常反应。所有患者均采用容量控制模式进行机械通气，并被动通气。在V(T)降低/增加1 mL/kg预计体重和PEEP降低/增加2.5cmh(2)O前后测量气道压。

结果：所有患者V(T)或PEEP均改善C(RS)。降低V(T)后，驾驶压力(DP)平均下降4.9 cmh2（仰卧位）和4.3 cmh2（俯卧位），降低PEEP后，平均下降2.9 cmh2（仰卧位）O和2.2 cmh2（俯卧位）。V(T)降低后，C(RS)平均增加3.1 mL/cmh2（仰卧位）和2.5 mL/cmh2（俯卧位）降低PEEP后，C(RS)平均增加5.2 mL/cmh2（仰卧位）和3.6 mL/cmh2（俯卧位）（P均 < 0.01）。在大多数患者中，V(T)或PEEP的小幅增加使C(RS)恶化。

结论：胸壁负荷反常反应的患者在V(T)或PEEP降低后DP和C(RS)均出现均匀改善，结果与之前的证据一致，表明DP和C(RS)的存在是潮气末过度膨胀的体征。“反常”的存在应及时重新评估潮气末过度膨胀的可改变的决定因素，包括V(T)、PEEP和体位。

## The future of intensive care: delirium should no longer be an issue

**Abstract**

In the ideal intensive care unit (ICU) of the future, all patients are free from delirium, a syndrome of brain dysfunction frequently observed in critical illness and associated with worse ICU-related outcomes and long-term cognitive impairment. Although screening for delirium requires limited time and effort, this devastating disorder remains underestimated during routine ICU care. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a catastrophic reduction in delirium monitoring, prevention, and patient care due to organizational issues, lack of personnel, increased use of benzodiazepines and restricted family visitation. These limitations led to increases in delirium incidence, a situation that should never be repeated. Good sedation practices should be complemented by novel ICU design and connectivity, which will facilitate non-pharmacological sedation, anxiolysis and comfort that can be supplemented by balanced pharmacological interventions when necessary. Improvements in the ICU sound, light control, floor planning, and room arrangement can facilitate a healing environment that minimizes stressors and aids delirium prevention and management. The fundamental prerequisite to realize the delirium-free ICU, is an awake non-sedated, pain-free comfortable patient whose management follows the A to F (A-F) bundle. Moreover, the bundle should be expanded with three additional letters, incorporating humanitarian care: gaining (G) insight into patient needs, delivering holistic care with a 'home-like' (H) environment, and redefining ICU architectural design (I). Above all, the delirium-free world relies upon people, with personal challenges for critical care teams to optimize design, environmental factors, management, time spent with the patient and family and to humanize ICU care.

##中文标题- 重症监护的未来：谵妄不应再成为一个问题

**摘要**

在未来理想的重症监护室(ICU)中，所有患者均未发生谵妄，谵妄是常见于危重疾病中的一种脑功能障碍综合征，与较差的ICU相关结局和长期认知障碍相关。尽管精神错乱的筛查需要有限的时间和精力，但是在常规ICU护理期间，这种破坏性的疾病仍然被低估。由于组织问题、人员不足、苯二氮卓类药物使用增加和家庭访视受限，COVID-19大流行使谵妄监测、预防和患者护理出现灾难性减少。这些限制导致谵妄发生率增加，这种情况不应重复发生。良好的镇静实践应辅以新型ICU设计和连接性，这将有助于非药物镇静、抗焦虑和舒适度，必要时可通过平衡药物干预进行补充。ICU声音、光照控制、楼层计划和房间布局的改善可促进愈合环境，最大限度地减少应激源，有助于谵妄的预防和管理。实现无谵妄ICU的基本前提是患者清醒、无镇静、无疼痛的舒适患者，其管理遵循A至F(A-F)束。此外，该工具包应额外增加3封信函，包括人道主义护理：获得(G)对患者需求的洞察，以“家庭样”(H)环境提供整体护理，并重新定义ICU建筑设计(I)。最重要的是，无谵妄的世界依赖于人，重症监护团队在优化设计、环境因素、管理、与患者和家庭共度的时间以及使ICU护理人性化方面存在个人挑战。

## Dynamics of disease characteristics and clinical management of critically ill COVID-19 patients over the time course of the pandemic: an analysis of the prospective, international, multicentre RISC-19-ICU registry

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: It remains elusive how the characteristics, the course of disease, the clinical management and the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) worldwide have changed over the course of the pandemic. 

METHODS: Prospective, observational registry constituted by 90 ICUs across 22 countries worldwide including patients with a laboratory-confirmed, critical presentation of COVID-19 requiring advanced organ support. Hierarchical, generalized linear mixed-effect models accounting for hospital and country variability were employed to analyse the continuous evolution of the studied variables over the pandemic. 

RESULTS: Four thousand forty-one patients were included from March 2020 to September 2021. Over this period, the age of the admitted patients (62 [95% CI 60-63] years vs 64 [62-66] years, p < 0.001) and the severity of organ dysfunction at ICU admission decreased (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 8.2 [7.6-9.0] vs 5.8 [5.3-6.4], p < 0.001) and increased, while more female patients (26 [23-29]% vs 41 [35-48]%, p < 0.001) were admitted. The time span between symptom onset and hospitalization as well as ICU admission became longer later in the pandemic (6.7 [6.2-7.2| days vs 9.7 [8.9-10.5] days, p < 0.001). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) at admission was lower (132 [123-141] mmHg vs 101 [91-113] mmHg, p < 0.001) but showed faster improvements over the initial 5 days of ICU stay in late 2021 compared to early 2020 (34 [20-48] mmHg vs 70 [41-100] mmHg, p = 0.05). The number of patients treated with steroids and tocilizumab increased, while the use of therapeutic anticoagulation presented an inverse U-shaped behaviour over the course of the pandemic. The proportion of patients treated with high-flow oxygen (5 [4-7]% vs 20 [14-29], p < 0.001) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (14 [11-18]% vs 24 [17-33]%, p < 0.001) throughout the pandemic increased concomitant to a decrease in invasive mechanical ventilation (82 [76-86]% vs 74 [64-82]%, p < 0.001). The ICU mortality (23 [19-26]% vs 17 [12-25]%, p < 0.001) and length of stay (14 [13-16] days vs 11 [10-13] days, p < 0.001) decreased over 19 months of the pandemic. 

CONCLUSION: Characteristics and disease course of critically ill COVID-19 patients have continuously evolved, concomitant to the clinical management, throughout the pandemic leading to a younger, less severely ill ICU population with distinctly different clinical, pulmonary and inflammatory presentations than at the onset of the pandemic.

##中文标题- 大流行期间COVID-19危重患者的疾病特征和临床管理的动态：前瞻性、国际、多中心RISC-19-ICU登记研究分析

**摘要**

背景：全球范围内入住重症监护室(ICU)的COVID-19重症患者的特征、病程、临床管理和结局如何在大流行期间发生改变仍不明确。

方法：前瞻性、观察性登记研究，由全球22个国家的90间ICU组成，包括实验室证实有需要晚期器官支持的COVID-19关键表现的患者。采用考虑医院和国家变异性的分层、广义线性混合效应模型分析研究变量在大流行期间的连续演变。

结果：从2020年3月至2021年9月纳入4,00041例患者。在此期间，入院患者的年龄（62[95%CI 60-63]岁vs 64[62-66]岁，p < 0.001）和ICU入院时器官功能障碍的严重程度降低（序贯器官衰竭评估8.2[7.6-9.0]vs 5.8[5.3-6.4]，p < 0.001）并增加，而女性患者更多（26[23-29]%vs 41[35-48]%，p < 0.001）。在大流行期间，症状发作与住院以及入住ICU之间的时间跨度变得更长（6.7[6.2-7.2天vs 9.7[8.9-10.5]天，p < 0.001）。入院时PaO(2)/FiO(2)较低(132[123-141]mmHg vs 101[91-113]mmHg，p < 0.001)，但与2020年初相比，2021年末在ICU住院的最初5天内改善更快(34[20-48]mmHg vs 70[41-100]mmHg，p = 0.05)。在大流行期间，接受类固醇和托珠单抗治疗的患者数量增加，而抗凝治疗的使用呈现相反的U形行为。在大流行期间，接受高流量氧气(5[4-7]%vs 20[14-29]，p < 0.001)和无创机械通气(14[11-18]%vs 24[17-33]%，p < 0.001)治疗的患者比例随着有创机械通气减少而增加(82[76-86]%vs 74[64-82]%，p < 0.001)。在大流行的19个月期间，ICU死亡率(23[19-26]%vs 17[12-25]%，p < 0.001)和住院时间（14[13-16]天vs 11[10-13]天，p < 0.001）降低。

结论：在大流行期间，伴随临床管理，COVID-19重症患者的特征和病程不断演变，导致更年轻、病情不太严重的ICU人群，与大流行开始时的临床、肺部和炎症表现明显不同。

## Sepsis subphenotyping based on organ dysfunction trajectory

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, and the identification of clinical subphenotypes is essential. Although organ dysfunction is a defining element of sepsis, subphenotypes of differential trajectory are not well studied. We sought to identify distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis. 

METHODS: We created 72-h SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from four diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used dynamic time warping (DTW) to compute heterogeneous SOFA trajectory similarities and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to identify trajectory-based subphenotypes. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership at 6 and 24 h after being admitted to the ICU. The model was tested on three validation cohorts. Sensitivity analyses were performed with alternative clustering methodologies. 

RESULTS: A total of 4678, 3665, 12,282, and 4804 unique sepsis patients were included in development and three validation cohorts, respectively. Four subphenotypes were identified in the development cohort: Rapidly Worsening (n = 612, 13.1%), Delayed Worsening (n = 960, 20.5%), Rapidly Improving (n = 1932, 41.3%), and Delayed Improving (n = 1174, 25.1%). Baseline characteristics, including the pattern of organ dysfunction, varied between subphenotypes. Rapidly Worsening was defined by a higher comorbidity burden, acidosis, and visceral organ dysfunction. Rapidly Improving was defined by vasopressor use without acidosis. Outcomes differed across the subphenotypes, Rapidly Worsening had the highest in-hospital mortality (28.3%, P-value < 0.001), despite a lower SOFA (mean: 4.5) at ICU admission compared to Rapidly Improving (mortality:5.5%, mean SOFA: 5.5). An overall prediction accuracy of 0.78 (95% CI, [0.77, 0.8]) was obtained at 6 h after ICU admission, which increased to 0.87 (95% CI, [0.86, 0.88]) at 24 h. Similar subphenotypes were replicated in three validation cohorts. The majority of patients with sepsis have an improving phenotype with a lower mortality risk; however, they make up over 20% of all deaths due to their larger numbers. 

CONCLUSIONS: Four novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Identifying trajectory-based subphenotypes has immediate implications for the powering and predictive enrichment of clinical trials. Understanding the pathophysiology of these differential trajectories may reveal unanticipated therapeutic targets and identify more precise populations and endpoints for clinical trials.

##中文标题- 基于器官功能障碍轨迹的败血症亚型

**摘要**

背景：脓毒症是一种异质性综合征，临床亚表型的识别至关重要。虽然器官功能障碍是败血症的定义要素，但差异轨迹的亚表型尚未充分研究。我们试图确定败血症中基于mrs的序贯器官衰竭评估(SOFA)评分亚表型。

方法：我们在4个不同的重症监护室(ICU)队列的败血症患者中创建了72h SOFA评分轨迹。然后，我们使用动态时间扭曲(DTW)计算异质性SOFA轨迹相似性，并使用分层聚类(HAC)来识别基于构型的亚表型。比较了亚表型之间的患者特征，并开发了随机森林模型，以预测入住ICU后6h和24h的亚表型成员。在3个验证队列中检验了模型。采用替代聚类方法进行敏感性分析。

结果：共有4678、3665、12,282和4804例独特败血症患者分别纳入开发队列和3个验证队列。在开发队列中确定了4个亚表型：快速恶化(n = 612，13.1%)、延迟恶化(n = 960，20.5%)、快速改善(n = 1932，41.3%)和延迟改善(n = 1174，25.1%)。基线特征，包括器官功能障碍的模式，在亚表型之间有所不同。快速恶化定义为较高的合并症负担、酸中毒和内脏器官功能障碍。迅速改善定义为使用血管加压药而无酸中毒。结局在各亚表型之间存在差异，尽管与快速改善（死亡率：5.5%，平均SOFA：5.5）相比，ICU入院时的SOFA（平均值：4.5）更低，但快速恶化的住院死亡率最高（28.3%，P值 < 0.001）。在ICU入院后6h获得0.78(95%CI,[0.77,0.8])的总体预测准确性，24h时增加至0.87(95%CI,[0.86,0.88])。在三个验证队列中重复相似的亚表型。大多数败血症患者的表型改善，死亡风险降低；然而，由于其数量较大，占所有死亡的20%以上。

结论：确定并验证了4种新的、临床定义的、膳食为基础的败血症亚表型。识别基于染色体的亚表型对临床试验的把握度和预测性富集具有直接影响。了解这些微分轨迹的病理生理学可能会揭示非预期的治疗靶点，并为临床试验确定更精确的人群和终点。

## An updated HACOR score for predicting the failure of noninvasive ventilation: a multicenter prospective observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate (HACOR) have been used to predict noninvasive ventilation (NIV) failure. However, the HACOR score fails to consider baseline data. Here, we aimed to update the HACOR score to take into account baseline data and test its predictive power for NIV failure primarily after 1-2 h of NIV. 

METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study was performed in 18 hospitals in China and Turkey. Patients who received NIV because of hypoxemic respiratory failure were enrolled. In Chongqing, China, 1451 patients were enrolled in the training cohort. Outside of Chongqing, another 728 patients were enrolled in the external validation cohort. 

RESULTS: Before NIV, the presence of pneumonia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary ARDS, immunosuppression, or septic shock and the SOFA score were strongly associated with NIV failure. These six variables as baseline data were added to the original HACOR score. The AUCs for predicting NIV failure were 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.87) and 0.78 (0.75-0.81) tested with the updated HACOR score assessed after 1-2 h of NIV in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. A higher AUC was observed when it was tested with the updated HACOR score compared to the original HACOR score in the training cohort (0.85 vs. 0.80, 0.86 vs. 0.81, and 0.85 vs. 0.82 after 1-2, 12, and 24 h of NIV, respectively; all p values < 0.01). Similar results were found in the validation cohort (0.78 vs. 0.71, 0.79 vs. 0.74, and 0.81 vs. 0.76, respectively; all p values < 0.01). When 7, 10.5, and 14 points of the updated HACOR score were used as cutoff values, the probability of NIV failure was 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. Among patients with updated HACOR scores of ≤ 7, 7.5-10.5, 11-14, and > 14 after 1-2 h of NIV, the rate of NIV failure was 12.4%, 38.2%, 67.1%, and 83.7%, respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS: The updated HACOR score has high predictive power for NIV failure in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. It can be used to help in decision-making when NIV is used.

##中文标题- 一项多中心前瞻性观察性研究：更新的HACOR评分用于预测无创通气失败

**摘要**

背景：心率、酸中毒、意识、氧合和呼吸频率(HACOR)已被用于预测无创通气(NIV)失败。但是，HACOR评分未考虑基线数据。在此，我们旨在更新HACOR评分，以考虑基线数据并检测其主要在NIV 1-2h后对NIV失败的预测能力。

方法：在中国和土耳其的18家医院进行了一项多中心前瞻性观察研究。入组了由于低氧性呼吸衰竭接受NIV的患者。在中国重庆，1451例患者入组培训队列。在重庆以外地区，另有728例患者入选外部验证队列。

结果：NIV前，肺炎、心源性肺水肿、肺ARDS、免疫抑制或感染性休克的存在以及SOFA评分与NIV失败密切相关。将这6个变量作为基线数据添加到原始HACOR评分中。使用培训和验证队列NIV 1-2h后评估的更新HACOR评分检验预测NIV失败的AUC分别为0.85(95%CI 0.84-0.87)和0.78(0.75-0.81)。在培训队列中，与原始HACOR评分相比，使用更新后的HACOR评分进行检验时，观察到更高的AUC（NIV 1-2、12和24 h后分别是0.85 vs. 0.80、0.86 vs. 0.81和0.85 vs. 0.82；所有p值均 < 0.01）。在验证队列中观察到相似的结果（分别为0.78对比0.71、0.79对比0.74和0.81对比0.76；所有p值均 < 0.01）。当使用更新的HACOR评分的7、10.5和14分作为截止值时，NIV失败的概率分别是25%、50%和75%。在NIV 1-2h后更新的HACOR评分≤7、7.5-10.5、11-14和 > 14的患者中，NIV失败率分别是12.4%、38.2%、67.1%和83.7%。

结论：在低氧性呼吸衰竭患者中，更新的HACOR评分对NIV衰竭具有较高的预测能力。当使用NIV时，其可用于帮助决策。

## The obesity paradox for survivors of critically ill patients

**Abstract**

The obesity paradox has been observed in short-term outcomes from critical illness. However, little is known regarding the impact of obesity on long-term outcomes for survivors of critically ill patients. We aimed to evaluate the influence of obesity on long-term mortality outcomes after discharge alive from ICU. The adult patients who were discharged alive from the last ICU admission were extracted. After exclusion, a total of 7619 adult patients discharged alive from ICU were included, with 4-year mortality of 32%. The median body mass index (BMI) was 27.2 (IQR 24-31.4) kg/m(2), and 2490 (31.5%) patients were classified as obese or morbidly obese. The morbidly obese patients had the highest ICU and hospital length of stay. However, higher BMI was associated with lower hazard ratio for 4-year mortality. The results showed the obesity paradox may be also suitable for survivors of critically ill patients.

##中文标题- 危重患者生存者的肥胖悖论

**摘要**

在危重疾病的短期结局中观察到了肥胖的矛盾。但是，关于肥胖对重症患者生存者长期结局的影响知之甚少。我们旨在评估从ICU存活出院后肥胖对长期死亡结局的影响。提取从最后一次进入ICU存活出院的成人患者。排除后，共纳入7619例从ICU存活出院的成人患者，4年死亡率为32%。中位体重指数(BMI)为27.2(IQR 24-31.4)kg/m2，2490名(31.5%)患者被分类为肥胖或病态肥胖。病态肥胖患者的ICU和住院时间最长。但是，BMI越高，4年死亡率的风险比越低。结果显示，肥胖悖论也可能适用于重症患者的生存者。

## Response to PEEP in COVID-19 ARDS patients with and without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation A multicenter case-control computed tomography study.

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: PEEP selection in severe COVID-19 patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is challenging as no study has assessed the alveolar recruitability in this setting. The aim of the study was to compare lung recruitability and the impact of PEEP on lung aeration in moderate and severe ARDS patients with or without ECMO, using computed tomography (CT). 

METHODS: We conducted a two-center prospective observational case-control study in adult COVID-19-related patients who had an indication for CT within 72 h of ARDS onset in non-ECMO patients or within 72  h after ECMO onset. Ninety-nine patients were included, of whom 24 had severe ARDS under ECMO, 59 severe ARDS without ECMO and 16 moderate ARDS. 

RESULTS: Non-inflated lung at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O was significantly greater in ECMO than in non-ECMO patients. Recruitment induced by increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O was not significantly different between ECMO and non-ECMO patients, while PEEP-induced hyperinflation was significantly lower in the ECMO group and virtually nonexistent. The median [IQR] fraction of recruitable lung mass between PEEP 5 and 15 cmH(2)O was 6 [4-10]%. Total superimposed pressure at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O was significantly higher in ECMO patients and amounted to 12 [11-13] cmH(2)O. The hyperinflation-to-recruitment ratio (i.e., a trade-off index of the adverse effects and benefits of PEEP) was significantly lower in ECMO patients and was lower than one in 23 (96%) ECMO patients, 41 (69%) severe non-ECMO patients and 8 (50%) moderate ARDS patients. Compliance of the aerated lung at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O corrected for PEEP-induced recruitment (C(BABY LUNG)) was significantly lower in ECMO patients than in non-ECMO patients and was linearly related to the logarithm of the hyperinflation-to-recruitment ratio. 

CONCLUSIONS: Lung recruitability of COVID-19 pneumonia is not significantly different between ECMO and non-ECMO patients, with substantial interindividual variations. The balance between hyperinflation and recruitment induced by PEEP increase from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O appears favorable in virtually all ECMO patients, while this PEEP level is required to counteract compressive forces leading to lung collapse. C(BABY LUNG) is significantly lower in ECMO patients, independently of lung recruitability.

##中文标题- 有和无体外膜肺氧合的COVID-19 ARDS患者对PEEP的反应：一项多中心、病例对照计算机断层扫描研究。

**摘要**

背景：体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)条件下选择重度COVID-19患者的PEEP具有挑战性，因为尚无研究评估这种情况下的肺泡可恢复性。本研究的目的是采用计算机断层扫描(CT)，在有或无ECMO的中度和重度ARDS患者中，比较肺复张力和PEEP对肺通气的影响。

方法：我们在成人COVID-19相关患者中进行了一项两中心前瞻性观察性病例对照研究，这些患者在非ECMO患者ARDS发作72h内或72h内有CT指征  ECMO发作后h。纳入99例患者，其中24例为ECMO下重度ARDS，59例为无ECMO下重度ARDS，16例为中度ARDS。

结果：与非ECMO患者相比，ECMO患者PEEP 5cmh2 O时的非充气肺显著更大。在ECMO和非ECMO患者之间，PEEP从5增加到15 cmh2 O诱导的募集没有显著差异，而PEEP诱导的过度充气在ECMO组中显著较低，几乎不存在。PEEP 5-15 cmh2 O之间可恢复肺质量的中位[IQR]分数为6[4-10]%。在ECMO患者中PEEP 5cmh2 O时的总叠加压显著较高，达12[11-13]cmh2 O。在ECMO患者中，过度充气与复张比率（即PEEP不良反应和获益的权衡指数）显著较低，低于23名ECMO患者中的1名(96%)。41例(69%)重度非ECMO患者和8例(50%)中度ARDS患者。与非ECMO患者相比，ECMO患者PEEP 5cmh2o(2)O时通气肺对PEEP诱导肺复张(C(BABY lung))的校正顺应性显著降低，且与过度充气-复张比率的对数呈线性相关。

结论：ECMO和非ECMO患者中COVID-19肺炎的肺复张力无显著差异，存在显著的个体间差异。在几乎所有的ECMO患者中，PEEP诱导的肺过度充气和肺复张之间的平衡从5增加到15 cmh2o(2)O似乎是有利的，而该PEEP水平需要抵消导致肺萎陷的压缩力。ECMO患者的C(BABY LUNG)显著较低，与肺复张性无关。

## Key characteristics impacting survival of COVID-19 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often requires extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Recent German health insurance data revealed low ICU survival rates. Patient characteristics and experience of the ECMO center may determine intensive care unit (ICU) survival. The current study aimed to identify factors affecting ICU survival of COVID-19 ECMO patients. 

METHODS: 673 COVID-19 ARDS ECMO patients treated in 26 centers between January 1st 2020 and March 22nd 2021 were included. Data on clinical characteristics, adjunct therapies, complications, and outcome were documented. Block wise logistic regression analysis was applied to identify variables associated with ICU-survival. 

RESULTS: Most patients were between 50 and 70 years of age. PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio prior to ECMO was 72 mmHg (IQR: 58-99). ICU survival was 31.4%. Survival was significantly lower during the 2nd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A subgroup of 284 (42%) patients fulfilling modified EOLIA criteria had a higher survival (38%) (p = 0.0014, OR 0.64 (CI 0.41-0.99)). Survival differed between low, intermediate, and high-volume centers with 20%, 30%, and 38%, respectively (p = 0.0024). Treatment in high volume centers resulted in an odds ratio of 0.55 (CI 0.28-1.02) compared to low volume centers. Additional factors associated with survival were younger age, shorter time between intubation and ECMO initiation, BMI > 35 (compared to < 25), absence of renal replacement therapy or major bleeding/thromboembolic events. 

CONCLUSIONS: Structural and patient-related factors, including age, comorbidities and ECMO case volume, determined the survival of COVID-19 ECMO. These factors combined with a more liberal ECMO indication during the 2nd wave may explain the reasonably overall low survival rate. Careful selection of patients and treatment in high volume ECMO centers was associated with higher odds of ICU survival.

##中文标题- 影响COVID-19体外膜肺氧合生存期的关键特征

**摘要**

背景：重度COVID-19诱导的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)通常需要体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)。最近的德国医疗保险数据显示，ICU存活率较低。患者特征和ECMO中心的经验可能决定重症监护室(ICU)的存活率。本研究旨在确定影响COVID-19 ECMO患者ICU存活率的因素。

方法：纳入2020年1月1日至2021年3月22日在26家中心接受治疗的673例COVID-19 ARDS ECMO患者。记录临床特征、辅助治疗、并发症和结局数据。采用区组逻辑回归分析确定与ICU-生存相关的变量。

结果：大多数患者的年龄在50-70岁之间。ECMO前的PaO(2)/FiO(2)比率为72 mmHg(IQR：58-99)。ICU存活率为31.4%。在COVID-19大流行的第2波期间，生存率显著降低。符合改良EOLIA标准的284例(42%)患者亚组的生存率较高(38%)(p = 0.0014，OR 0.64(CI 0.41-0.99))。低容量、中等容量和高容量中心的生存率不同，分别为20%、30%和38%(p = 0.0024)。高容量中心的治疗得到的比值比为0.55(CI 0.28-1.02)，相比之下，低容量中心。与生存相关的其他因素包括年龄较小、插管和ECMO启动之间的时间较短、BMI > 35（与 < 25相比）、未进行肾脏替代治疗或未发生大出血/血栓栓塞事件。

结论：结构和患者相关因素，包括年龄、合并症和ECMO病例体积，决定了COVID-19 ECMO的存活率。这些因素结合第二波期间更自由的ECMO指征可能解释了合理的总体低生存率。仔细选择患者和在高容量ECMO中心进行治疗与ICU存活率较高相关。

##中文标题- 在COVID-19诱导的急性低氧性呼吸衰竭患者中，对清醒俯卧位定位的肺部超声反应预测插管的需要：一项观察性研究

**摘要**

背景：清醒俯卧位(APP)降低了接受高流量鼻插管(HFNC)治疗的COVID-19患者的插管率。但是，APP的肺通气反应尚未得到解决。我们旨在通过肺部超声(LUS)探索APP的肺通气反应。

方法：这是一项两中心、前瞻性、观察性研究，入组了通过HFNC和APP治疗的COVID-19诱导的急性低氧性呼吸衰竭患者。在前3天内的第1次APP运行前5-10 min、APP后1h和仰卧位后5-10 min记录LUS评分。主要结局是前3天LUS评分的变化。次要结局包括与APP相关的SpO(2)/FiO(2)比值、呼吸频率和ROX指数（SpO(2)/FiO(2)/呼吸频率）的变化，以及治疗成功率（避免插管的患者）。

结果：入组71例患者。首次APP治疗后，LUS评分从20（四分位距[IQR]19-24）降至19(18-21)(p < 0.001)，3天后降至19(18-21)(p < 0.001)。与治疗失败的患者(n = 20，28%)相比，治疗成功患者(n = 51)前3天后的LUS评分降低更大（-2.6[95%置信区间-3.1至-2.0]vs 0[-1.2至1.2]，p = 0.001）。APP首次治疗后背侧LUS评分降低 > 1与插管风险降低相关（相对风险0.25[0.09-0.69]）。在治疗成功的患者中，APP每日持续时间与LUS评分降低相关，尤其是背侧肺区（r =  - 0.76; p < 0.001).

结论：在COVID-19导致急性低氧性呼吸衰竭并接受HFNC治疗的患者中，APP降低了LUS评分。APP后背侧LUS评分的降低与治疗成功相关。APP持续时间越长，肺通气量越大。

## Lung ultrasound response to awake prone positioning predicts the need for intubation in patients with COVID-19 induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: an observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning (APP) reduces the intubation rate in COVID-19 patients treated by high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the lung aeration response to APP has not been addressed. We aimed to explore the lung aeration response to APP by lung ultrasound (LUS). 

METHODS: This two-center, prospective, observational study enrolled patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated by HFNC and APP. LUS score was recorded 5-10 min before, 1 h after APP, and 5-10 min after supine in the first APP session within the first three days. The primary outcome was LUS score changes in the first three days. Secondary outcomes included changes in SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, respiratory rate and ROX index (SpO(2)/FiO(2)/respiratory rate) related to APP, and the rate of treatment success (patients who avoided intubation). 

RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were enrolled. LUS score decreased from 20 (interquartile range [IQR] 19-24) to 19 (18-21) (p < 0.001) after the first APP session, and to 19 (18-21) (p < 0.001) after three days. Compared to patients with treatment failure (n = 20, 28%), LUS score reduction after the first three days in patients with treatment success (n = 51) was greater (- 2.6 [95% confidence intervals - 3.1 to - 2.0] vs 0 [- 1.2 to 1.2], p = 0.001). A decrease in dorsal LUS score > 1 after the first APP session was associated with decreased risk for intubation (Relative risk 0.25 [0.09-0.69]). APP daily duration was correlated with LUS score reduction in patients with treatment success, especially in dorsal lung zones (r =  - 0.76; p < 0.001). 

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and treated by HFNC, APP reduced LUS score. The reduction in dorsal LUS scores after APP was associated with treatment success. The longer duration on APP was correlated with greater lung aeration.

## The PROMIZING trial enrollment algorithm for early identification of patients ready for unassisted breathing

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Liberating patients from mechanical ventilation (MV) requires a systematic approach. In the context of a clinical trial, we developed a simple algorithm to identify patients who tolerate assisted ventilation but still require ongoing MV to be randomized. We report on the use of this algorithm to screen potential trial participants for enrollment and subsequent randomization in the Proportional Assist Ventilation for Minimizing the Duration of MV (PROMIZING) study. 

METHODS: The algorithm included five steps: enrollment criteria, pressure support ventilation (PSV) tolerance trial, weaning criteria, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) tolerance trial (0 cmH(2)O during 2 min) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT): on fraction of inspired oxygen (F(i)O(2)) 40% for 30-120 min. Patients who failed the weaning criteria, CPAP Zero trial, or SBT were randomized. We describe the characteristics of patients who were initially enrolled, but passed all steps in the algorithm and consequently were not randomized. 

RESULTS: Among the 374 enrolled patients, 93 (25%) patients passed all five steps. At time of enrollment, most patients were on PSV (87%) with a mean (± standard deviation) F(i)O(2) of 34 (± 6) %, PSV of 8.7 (± 2.9) cmH(2)O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 6.1 (± 1.6) cmH(2)O. Minute ventilation was 9.0 (± 3.1) L/min with a respiratory rate of 17.4 (± 4.4) breaths/min. Patients were liberated from MV with a median [interquartile range] delay between initial screening and extubation of 5 [1-49] hours. Only 7 (8%) patients required reintubation. 

CONCLUSION: The trial algorithm permitted identification of 93 (25%) patients who were ready to extubate, while their clinicians predicted a duration of ventilation higher than 24 h.

##中文标题- PROMIZING试验招募算法，用于早期识别准备进行无辅助呼吸的患者

**摘要**

背景：使患者摆脱机械通气(MV)需要一种系统的方法。在临床试验的背景下，我们开发了一种简单的算法来识别耐受辅助通气但仍需要持续MV的患者，以进行随机化。我们报告了使用该算法筛查比例辅助通气以尽量减少MV持续时间(PROMIZING)研究中潜在试验参与者的入组和后续随机分配。

方法：该算法包括五个步骤：入组标准、压力支持通气(PSV)耐受性试验、撤机标准、持续气道正压通气(CPAP)耐受性试验（2 min期间0 cmh2）和自主呼吸试验(SBT)：吸入氧浓度(F(i)o2)40%，持续30-120 min。随机分配不符合撤机标准、CPAP Zero试验或SBT的患者。我们描述了最初入组，但通过算法中所有步骤，因此未进行随机化的患者特征。

结果：在374例入组患者中，93例(25%)患者通过所有5个步骤。入组时，大多数患者接受PSV(87%)，平均（±标准差）F(i)O(2)为34(±6)%，PSV为8.7(±2.9)cmH(2)O，呼气末正压为6.1(±1.6)cmH(2)O。每分钟通气量为9.0(±3.1)L/min，呼吸率为17.4(±4.4)次/min。患者从MV中解放出来，从初始筛选到拔管的延迟时间中位数[四分位距]为5[1-49]小时。仅7例(8%)患者需要重新插管。

结论：试验方案允许识别93例(25%)准备拔管的患者，而他们的临床医生预测通气持续时间超过24h。

## Fluid challenge in critically ill patients receiving haemodynamic monitoring: a systematic review and comparison of two decades

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Fluid challenges are widely adopted in critically ill patients to reverse haemodynamic instability. We reviewed the literature to appraise fluid challenge characteristics in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving haemodynamic monitoring and considered two decades: 2000-2010 and 2011-2021. 

METHODS: We assessed research studies and collected data regarding study setting, patient population, fluid challenge characteristics, and monitoring. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane search engines were used. A fluid challenge was defined as an infusion of a definite quantity of fluid (expressed as a volume in mL or ml/kg) in a fixed time (expressed in minutes), whose outcome was defined as a change in predefined haemodynamic variables above a predetermined threshold. 

RESULTS: We included 124 studies, 32 (25.8%) published in 2000-2010 and 92 (74.2%) in 2011-2021, overall enrolling 6,086 patients, who presented sepsis/septic shock in 50.6% of cases. The fluid challenge usually consisted of 500 mL (76.6%) of crystalloids (56.6%) infused with a rate of 25 mL/min. Fluid responsiveness was usually defined by a cardiac output/index (CO/CI) increase ≥ 15% (70.9%). The infusion time was quicker (15 min vs 30 min), and crystalloids were more frequent in the 2011-2021 compared to the 2000-2010 period. 

CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, fluid challenges are usually performed by infusing 500 mL of crystalloids bolus in less than 20 min. A positive fluid challenge response, reported in 52% of ICU patients, is generally defined by a CO/CI increase ≥ 15%. Compared to the 2000-2010 decade, in 2011-2021 the infusion time of the fluid challenge was shorter, and crystalloids were more frequently used.

##中文标题- 接受血液动力学监测的重症患者的液体挑战：一项20年的系统综述和比较

**摘要**

引言：液体挑战被广泛用于重症患者，以逆转血液动力学不稳定。我们审查了评价接受血液动力学监测的重症监护室(ICU)患者的液体挑战特征的文献，并考虑了20年：2000-2010年和2011-2021。

方法：我们评估了研究并收集了关于研究设置、患者人群、液体挑战特征和监测的数据。使用了MEDLINE、Embase和Cochrane搜索引擎。液体激发定义为在固定时间（以分钟表示）内输注一定量的液体（表示为体积，mL或mL/kg），其结局定义为预定血液动力学变量变化高于预定阈值。

结果：我们纳入了124项研究，32项(25.8%)于2000年-2010年发表，92项(74.2%)于2011-2021年发表，共纳入6086例患者，50.6%的病例出现败血症/感染性休克。液体挑战通常包括500 mL(76.6%)晶体液(56.6%)，输注速率为25 mL/min。液体反应性通常定义为心输出量/指数(CO/CI)增加≥15%(70.9%)。与2000-2010年相比，2011-2021年的输注时间更快(15 min vs 30 min)，晶体液使用频率更高。

结论：在文献中，通常在20 min内静脉推注500 mL晶体液进行液体激发。52%的ICU患者报告了阳性液体激发反应，通常定义为CO/CI增加≥15%。与2000-2010年间的十年相比，2011-2021液体激发的输注时间更短，晶体液的使用更频繁。

## Advanced interventions in the pre-hospital resuscitation of patients with non-compressible haemorrhage after penetrating injuries

**Abstract**

Early haemorrhage control and minimizing the time to definitive care have long been the cornerstones of therapy for patients exsanguinating from non-compressible haemorrhage (NCH) after penetrating injuries, as only basic treatment could be provided on scene. However, more recently, advanced on-scene treatments such as the transfusion of blood products, resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) and resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) have become available in a small number of pre-hospital critical care teams. Although these advanced techniques are included in the current traumatic cardiac arrest algorithm of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), published in 2021, clear guidance on the practical application of these techniques in the pre-hospital setting is scarce. This paper provides a scoping review on how these advanced techniques can be incorporated into practice for the resuscitation of patients exsanguinating from NCH after penetrating injuries, based on available literature and the collective experience of several helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) across Europe who have introduced these advanced resuscitation interventions into routine practice.

##中文标题- 穿透伤后非压迫性出血患者院前复苏的高级干预措施

**摘要**

对于穿透伤后从非压迫性出血(NCH)放血的患者，早期出血控制和尽量缩短至确定性治疗的时间一直是治疗的基础，因为现场只能提供基础治疗。但是，最近，少数院前重症监护团队提供先进的现场治疗，如输注血液制品、复苏性开胸术(RT)和复苏性血管内球囊闭塞主动脉(REBOA)。尽管这些先进技术被纳入2021年发布的欧洲复苏委员会(ERC)现行创伤性心脏骤停规则中，但很少有关于这些技术在院前环境中实际应用的明确指南。本文就如何将这些先进技术用于穿透伤后从NCH放血患者的复苏进行了范围审查，基于现有文献以及欧洲数家急救直升机(HEMS)的共同经验，这些人员将这些先进的复苏干预措施引入了常规实践中。

## Driving pressure-guided ventilation decreases the mechanical power compared to predicted body weight-guided ventilation in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Whether targeting the driving pressure (∆P) when adjusting the tidal volume in mechanically ventilated patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may decrease the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury remains a matter of research. In this study, we assessed the effect of a ∆P-guided ventilation on the mechanical power. 

METHODS: We prospectively included adult patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Positive end expiratory pressure was set by the attending physician and kept constant during the study. Tidal volume was first adjusted to target 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW-guided ventilation) and subsequently modified within a range from 4 to 10 ml/kg PBW to target a ∆P between 12 and 14 cm H(2)O. The respiratory rate was then re-adjusted within a range from 12 to 40 breaths/min until EtCO(2) returned to its baseline value (∆P-guided ventilation). Mechanical power was computed at each step. 

RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included between December 2019 and May 2021. ∆P-guided ventilation was feasible in all but one patient. The ∆P during PBW-guided ventilation was already within the target range of ∆P-guided ventilation in five (10%) patients, above in nine (18%) and below in 36 (72%). The change from PBW- to ∆P-guided ventilation was thus accompanied by an overall increase in tidal volume from 6.1 mL/kg PBW [5.9-6.2] to 7.7 ml/kg PBW [6.2-8.7], while respiratory rate was decreased from 29 breaths/min [26-32] to 21 breaths/min [16-28] (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). ∆P-guided ventilation was accompanied by a significant decrease in mechanical power from 31.5 J/min [28-35.7] to 28.8 J/min [24.6-32.6] (p < 0.001), representing a relative decrease of 7% [0-16]. With ∆P-guided ventilation, the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased and the ventilatory ratio decreased. 

CONCLUSION: As compared to a conventional PBW-guided ventilation, a ∆P-guided ventilation strategy targeting a ∆P between 12 and 14 cm H(2)O required to change the tidal volume in 90% of the patients. Such ∆P-guided ventilation significantly reduced the mechanical power. Whether this physiological observation could be associated with clinical benefit should be assessed in clinical trials.

##中文标题- 在急性呼吸窘迫综合征中，与预测的体重引导通气相比，驾驶压力引导通气降低了机械功率

**摘要**

背景：在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)机械通气患者中，调整潮气量时以驱动压力(∆P)为目标是否可能降低呼吸机诱导的肺损伤风险仍是一个研究问题。在本研究中，我们评估了∆P引导的通气对机械动力的影响。

方法：我们前瞻性纳入了中重度ARDS成人患者。由主治医生设定呼气末正压，并在研究期间保持不变。首先将潮气量调整至6 mL/kg的预期体重目标（PBW引导通气），随后将潮气量调整至4-10 mL/kg PBW的范围内，以达到12-14 cm h2的ΔP。然后将呼吸率重新调整至12-40次/min的范围内，直至EtCO(2)恢复至其基线水平。e值（∆P引导通气）。在每个步骤中计算机械动力。

结果：2019年12月至2021年5月期间纳入51例患者。除1例患者外，ΔP引导通气均可行。PBW引导通气期间，5例(10%)患者的ΔP已在ΔP引导通气的目标范围内，9例(18%)高于，36例(72%)低于。因此，从PBW至∆P引导通气的变化伴随潮气量的总体增加，从6.1 mL/kg PBW[5.9-6.2]增至7.7 mL/kg PBW[6.2-8.7]，而呼吸率从29次/分[26-32]降至21次/分[16-28]（所有比较均为P < 0.001）。∆P-引导通气伴随着机械功率从31.5 J/min[28-35.7]显著下降至28.8 J/min[24.6-32.6](P < 0.001)，代表了相对下降7%[0-16]。在∆P引导通气下，PaO(2)/FiO(2)比率升高，通气比率降低。

结论：与常规PBW引导通气相比，90%的患者需要以12-14 cm h2 O的ΔP为目标的ΔP引导通气策略改变潮气量。这种∆P引导通气显著降低了机械功率。应在临床试验中评估这种生理学观察结果是否与临床获益相关。

## Effect of intravenous clarithromycin in patients with sepsis, respiratory and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome: a randomized clinical trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin may act as immune-regulating treatment in sepsis and acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome. However, clinical evidence remains inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate whether clarithromycin improves 28-day mortality among patients with sepsis, respiratory and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial in patients with sepsis. Participants with ratio of partial oxygen pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen less than 200 and more than 3 SOFA points from systems other than the respiratory function were enrolled between December 2017 and September 2019. Patients were randomized to receive 1 gr of clarithromycin or placebo intravenously once daily for 4 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality; sepsis response (defined as at least 25% decrease in SOFA score by day 7); sepsis recurrence; and differences in peripheral blood cell populations and leukocyte transcriptomics. 

RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were allocated to each arm. By day 28, 27 (49.1%) patients in the clarithromycin and 25 (45.5%) in the placebo group died (risk difference 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) - 15.7 to 22.7]; P = 0.703, adjusted OR 1.03 [95%CI 0.35-3.06]; P = 0.959). There were no statistical differences in 90-day mortality and sepsis response. Clarithromycin was associated with lower incidence of sepsis recurrence (OR 0.21 [95%CI 0.06-0.68]; P = 0.012); significant increase in monocyte HLA-DR expression; expansion of non-classical monocytes; and upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Serious and non-serious adverse events were equally distributed. 

CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin did not reduce mortality among patients with sepsis with respiratory and multiple organ dysfunction. Clarithromycin was associated with lower sepsis recurrence, possibly through a mechanism of immune restoration.

##中文标题- 静脉注射克拉霉素对脓毒症、呼吸和多器官功能障碍综合征患者的影响：一项随机临床试验

**摘要**

背景：克拉霉素可作为败血症和急性呼吸功能障碍综合征的免疫调节治疗。但是，临床证据仍不确定。我们旨在评价克拉霉素是否能改善败血症、呼吸和多器官功能障碍综合征患者的28天死亡率。

方法：我们在败血症患者中进行了一项多中心、随机化、临床试验。2017年12月至2019年9月期间，入组了来自呼吸功能以外系统的小于200个SOFA点和大于3个SOFA点的氧分压与吸入氧分数比值的受试者。患者随机接受1 gr克拉霉素或安慰剂静脉输注，每日一次，连续4天。主要终点为28天全因死亡率。次要结局为90天死亡率；败血症缓解（定义为第7天SOFA评分至少降低25%）；败血症复发；以及外周血细胞群和白细胞转录组的差异。

结果：每组分配55例患者。截至第28天，克拉霉素组27例(49.1%)患者和安慰剂组25例(45.5%)患者死亡（风险差异3.6%[95%置信区间(CI)-15.7-22.7]；P = 0.703，调整后OR 1.03[95%CI 0.35-3.06]；P = 0.959）。90天死亡率和败血症反应无统计学差异。克拉霉素与败血症复发率较低相关(OR 0.21[95%CI 0.06-0.68]；P = 0.012)；单核细胞HLA-DR表达显著增加；非经典单核细胞扩增；胆固醇稳态相关基因上调。严重和非严重不良事件分布均衡。

结论：在伴有呼吸和多器官功能障碍的败血症患者中，克拉霉素并未降低死亡率。克拉霉素与败血症复发率较低相关，可能是通过免疫恢复机制所致。临床试验登记clinicaltrials.gov2017年11月17日注册的标识NCT03345992；EudraCT 2017-001056-55。

## Safety and efficacy of the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter to remove bacteria from the blood stream: results of the first in human study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Bacterial burden as well as duration of bacteremia influence the outcome of patients with bloodstream infections. Promptly decreasing bacterial load in the blood by using extracorporeal devices in addition to anti-infective therapy has recently been explored. Preclinical studies with the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph® 100), which consists of heparin that is covalently bound to polymer beads, have demonstrated an effective binding of bacteria and viruses. Pathogens adhere to the heparin coated polymer beads in the adsorber as they would normally do to heparan sulfate on cell surfaces. Using this biomimetic principle, the Seraph® 100 could help to decrease bacterial burden in vivo. 

METHODS: This first in human, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized interventional study included patients with blood culture positive bloodstream infection and the need for kidney replacement therapy as an adjunctive treatment for bloodstream infections. We performed a single four-hour hemoperfusion treatment with the Seraph® 100 in conjunction with a dialysis procedure. Post procedure follow up was 14 days. 

RESULTS: Fifteen hemodialysis patients (3F/12 M, age 74.0 [68.0-78.5] years, dialysis vintage 28.0 [11.0-45.0] months) were enrolled. Seraph® 100 treatment started 66.4 [45.7-80.6] hours after the initial positive blood culture was drawn. During the treatment with the Seraph® 100 with a median blood flow of 285 [225-300] ml/min no device or treatment related adverse events were reported. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable while peripheral oxygen saturation improved during the treatment from 98.0 [92.5-98.0] to 99.0 [98.0-99.5] %; p = 0.0184. Four patients still had positive blood culture at the start of Seraph® 100 treatment. In one patient blood cultures turned negative during treatment. The time to positivity (TTP) was increased between inflow and outflow blood cultures by 36 [- 7.2 to 96.3] minutes. However, overall TTP increase was not statistical significant. 

CONCLUSIONS: Seraph® 100 treatment was well tolerated. Adding Seraph® 100 to antibiotics early in the course of bacteremia might result in a faster resolution of bloodstream infections, which has to be evaluated in further studies.

##中文标题- Seraph®100 Microbind®Affinity血液滤器去除血流中细菌的安全性和有效性：首次人体研究结果

**摘要**

背景：细菌负荷以及菌血症持续时间影响血液感染患者的结局。最近还探索了在抗感染治疗的同时使用体外装置来迅速降低血液中的细菌负荷。Seraph®100 Microbind®Affinity Blood Filter(Seraph®100)的临床前研究已经证明，这种膜由共价结合到聚合物微球上的肝素组成，可以有效结合细菌和病毒。病原体粘附于吸附仪中肝素包被的聚合物珠，因为它们通常会吸附细胞表面的硫酸肝素。利用这种仿生原理，Seraph®100有助于减少体内细菌负荷。

方法：这是首次人体、前瞻性、多中心、非随机干预性研究，纳入了血培养阳性血流感染且需要肾脏替代治疗作为血流感染辅助治疗的患者。我们采用Seraph®100进行了单次4小时血液灌流治疗联合透析操作。术后随访14天。

结果：入选了15例血液透析患者（3F/12 M，年龄74.0[68.0-78.5]岁，透析时间28.0[11.0-45.0]个月）。在首次血培养阳性后66.4[45.7-80.6]小时开始Seraph®100治疗。在血流中值为285[225-300]ml/min的Seraph®100治疗期间，未报告与装置或治疗相关的不良事件。治疗期间，血压和心率保持稳定，而外周血氧饱和度从98.0[92.5-98.0]改善至99.0[98.0-99.5]%；p = 0.0184。4例患者在开始Seraph®100治疗时血培养仍为阳性。治疗期间，1例患者的血培养结果转为阴性。血液流入和流出培养物之间的至阳性时间(TTP)增加了36[-7.2至96.3]分钟。但是，总体TTP增加无统计学显著性。

结论：Seraph®100治疗耐受性良好。在菌血症早期抗生素治疗的基础上加用Seraph®100，可能会使血液感染更快消退，这需要在进一步的研究中进行评价。TRAIL注册：ClinicalTrials.gov识别码：NCT02914132，2016年9月26日首次发布。

## Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Andexanet alfa is approved (FDA "accelerated approval"; EMA "conditional approval") as the first specific reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor-associated uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) are commonly used as an off-label, non-specific, factor replacement approach to manage FXa inhibitor-associated life-threatening bleeding. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of andexanet alfa versus 4F-PCC for management of apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). 

METHODS: This two-cohort comparison study included andexanet alfa patients enrolled at US hospitals from 4/2015 to 3/2020 in the prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 study and a synthetic control arm of 4F-PCC patients admitted within a US healthcare system from 12/2016 to 8/2020. Adults with radiographically confirmed ICH who took their last dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban < 24 h prior to the bleed were included. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 7, hematoma volume > 60 mL, or planned surgery within 12 h were excluded. Outcomes were hemostatic effectiveness from index to repeat scan, mortality within 30 days, and thrombotic events within five days. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using propensity score-overlap weighted logistic regression. 

RESULTS: The study included 107 andexanet alfa (96.6% low dose) and 95 4F-PCC patients (79.3% receiving a 25 unit/kg dose). After propensity score-overlap weighting, mean age was 79 years, GCS was 14, time from initial scan to reversal initiation was 2.3 h, and time from reversal to repeat scan was 12.2 h in both arms. Atrial fibrillation was present in 86% of patients. Most ICHs were single compartment (78%), trauma-related (61%), and involved the intracerebral and/or intraventricular space(s) (53%). ICH size was ≥ 10 mL in volume (intracerebral and/or ventricular) or ≥ 10 mm in thickness (subdural or subarachnoid) in 22% of patients and infratentorial in 15%. Andexanet alfa was associated with greater odds of achieving hemostatic effectiveness (85.8% vs. 68.1%; OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.16-6.42) and decreased odds of mortality (7.9% vs. 19.6%; OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.13-0.98) versus 4F-PCC. Two thrombotic events occurred with andexanet alfa and none with 4F-PCC. 

CONCLUSIONS: In this indirect comparison of patients with an apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated ICH, andexanet alfa was associated with better hemostatic effectiveness and improved survival compared to 4F-PCC.

##中文标题- Andexanet α与四因素凝血酶原复合物浓缩制剂逆转阿哌沙班或利伐沙班相关的颅内出血：倾向评分重叠加权分析

**摘要**

背景：Andexanet α获批（FDA“加速批准”；EMA“条件性批准”）作为Xa因子(FXa)抑制剂相关的未控制或危及生命的出血的首个特异性逆转剂。四因素凝血酶原复合物浓缩物(4F-PCC)通常用作标签外、非特异性因子替代方法，以管理FXa抑制剂相关危及生命的出血。我们评价了andexanet α对比4F-PCC治疗阿哌沙班或利伐沙班相关颅内出血(ICH)的有效性和安全性。

方法：这项双队列比较研究纳入了2015年4月至2020年3月在美国医院入组的andexanet α患者，参加了前瞻性、单组ANNEXA-4研究，并纳入了2016年12月至2020年8月在美国医疗保健系统住院的4F-PCC患者的合成对照组。纳入了伴有放射学证实的ICH且在出血前 < 24h接受阿哌沙班或利伐沙班末次给药的成人。排除Glasgow昏迷量表(GCS)评分<7分、血肿量>60 mL或12 h内计划手术的患者。结局为从指数到重复扫描的止血有效性、30天内死亡率和5天内血栓形成事件。采用倾向得分重叠加权logistic回归计算95%置信区间(CI)的优势比(OR)。

结果：研究包括107名andexanet α（96.6%低剂量）和95名4F-PCC患者（79.3%接受25单位/kg剂量）。倾向评分重叠加权后，两组的平均年龄为79岁，GCS为14，从初始扫描到逆转开始的时间为2.3h，从逆转到重复扫描的时间为12.2h。86%的患者存在房颤。大多数ICH为单室(78%)、创伤相关(61%)，并涉及脑内和/或心室内空间(53%)。22%的患者ICH体积≥10 mL（脑内和/或脑室）或厚度≥10 mm（硬膜下或蛛网膜下腔），15%为幕下。Andexanet α与4F-PCC相比，实现止血有效性的几率更大(85.8%vs. 68.1%；OR 2.73；95%CI 1.16-6.42)，死亡率的几率下降(7.9%vs. 19.6%；OR 0.36；95%CI 0.13-0.98)。andexanet α组发生了2例血栓事件，4F-PCC组未发生。

结论：在这项阿哌沙班或利伐沙班相关ICH患者的间接比较中，与4F-PCC相比，andexanet α的止血效果更好，生存期改善。

## A dual-center cohort study on the association between early deep sedation and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: The COVID-SED study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Mechanically ventilated patients have experienced greater periods of prolonged deep sedation during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Multiple studies from the pre-COVID era demonstrate that early deep sedation is associated with worse outcome. Despite this, there is a lack of data on sedation depth and its impact on outcome for mechanically ventilated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to characterize the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) sedation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine if early deep sedation was associated with worse clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND 

METHODS: Dual-center, retrospective cohort study conducted over 6 months (March-August, 2020), involving consecutive, mechanically ventilated adults. All sedation-related data during the first 48 h were collected. Deep sedation was defined as Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of - 3 to - 5 or Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale of 1-3. To examine impact of early sedation depth on hospital mortality (primary outcome), we used a multivariable logistic regression model. Secondary outcomes included ventilator-, ICU-, and hospital-free days. 

RESULTS: 391 patients were studied, and 283 (72.4%) experienced early deep sedation. Deeply sedated patients received higher cumulative doses of fentanyl, propofol, midazolam, and ketamine when compared to light sedation. Deep sedation patients experienced fewer ventilator-, ICU-, and hospital-free days, and greater mortality (30.4% versus 11.1%) when compared to light sedation (p < 0.01 for all). After adjusting for confounders, early deep sedation remained significantly associated with higher mortality (adjusted OR 3.44; 95% CI 1.65-7.17; p < 0.01). These results were stable in the subgroup of patients with COVID-19. 

CONCLUSIONS: The management of sedation for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU has changed during the COVID pandemic. Early deep sedation is common and independently associated with worse clinical outcomes. A protocol-driven approach to sedation, targeting light sedation as early as possible, should continue to remain the default approach.

##中文标题- 一项关于COVID-19大流行期间机械通气患者早期深度镇静与临床结局相关性的双中心队列研究：COVID-SED研究

**摘要**

背景：在冠状病毒病(COVID-19)大流行期间，机械通气患者经历了更长时间的深度镇静。来自COVID前时代的多项研究证实，早期深度镇静与较差结局相关。尽管如此，在COVID-19流行期间，缺乏关于镇静深度及其对机械通气患者结局影响的数据。我们试图描述COVID-19大流行期间急诊科(ED)和重症监护室(ICU)镇静实践的特征，并确定早期深度镇静是否与较差的临床结局相关。研究设计和

方法：在6个月（2020年3月-8月）内进行了双中心、回顾性队列研究，涉及连续的机械通气成人。收集了前48h内的所有镇静相关数据。深度镇静定义为Richmond躁动-镇静量表为-3至-5或Riker镇静-躁动量表为1-3。为了检查早期镇静深度对住院死亡率（主要结局）的影响，我们使用了多变量logistic回归模型。次要结局包括无呼吸机、ICU和住院天数。

结果：研究了391例患者，283例(72.4%)经历了早期深度镇静。与轻度镇静相比，深度镇静的患者接受了更高的芬太尼、丙泊酚、咪达唑仑和氯胺酮累积剂量。与轻度镇静相比，深度镇静患者出现无呼吸机、ICU和住院的天数更少，死亡率更高（30.4%对比11.1%）（均为p < 0.01）。在调整混杂因素后，早期深度镇静仍然与死亡率升高显著相关（调整后OR 3.44；95%CI 1.65-7.17；p < 0.01）。这些结果在COVID-19患者亚组中稳定。

结论：在COVID大流行期间，ICU中机械通气患者的镇静管理发生了变化。早期深度镇静很常见，并且与较差的临床结局独立相关。方案驱动的镇静方法，尽早靶向轻度镇静，应继续作为默认方法。

## Expert clinical pharmacological advice may make an antimicrobial TDM program for emerging candidates more clinically useful in tailoring therapy of critically ill patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may represent an invaluable tool for optimizing antimicrobial therapy in septic patients, but extensive use is burdened by barriers. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a newly established expert clinical pharmacological advice (ECPA) program in improving the clinical usefulness of an already existing TDM program for emerging candidates in tailoring antimicrobial therapy among critically ill patients. 

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included an organizational phase (OP) and an assessment phase (AP). During the OP (January-June 2021), specific actions were organized by MD clinical pharmacologists together with bioanalytical experts, clinical engineers, and ICU clinicians. During the AP (July-December 2021), the impact of these actions in optimizing antimicrobial treatment of the critically ill patients was assessed. Four indicators of performance of the TDM-guided real-time ECPA program were identified [total TDM-guided ECPAs July-December 2021/total TDM results July-December 2020; total ECPA dosing adjustments/total delivered ECPAs both at first assessment and overall; and turnaround time (TAT) of ECPAs, defined as optimal (< 12 h), quasi-optimal (12-24 h), acceptable (24-48 h), suboptimal (> 48 h)]. 

RESULTS: The OP allowed to implement new organizational procedures, to create a dedicated pathway in the intranet system, to offer educational webinars on clinical pharmacology of antimicrobials, and to establish a multidisciplinary team at the morning bedside ICU meeting. In the AP, a total of 640 ECPAs were provided for optimizing 261 courses of antimicrobial therapy in 166 critically ill patients. ECPAs concerned mainly piperacillin-tazobactam (41.8%) and meropenem (24.9%), and also other antimicrobials had ≥ 10 ECPAs (ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ganciclovir, levofloxacin, and linezolid). Overall, the pre-post-increase in TDM activity was of 13.3-fold. TDM-guided dosing adjustments were recommended at first assessment in 61.7% of ECPAs (10.7% increases and 51.0% decreases), and overall in 45.0% of ECPAs (10.0% increases and 35.0% decreases). The overall median TAT was optimal (7.7 h) and that of each single agent was always optimal or quasi-optimal. 

CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary approach and timely expert interpretation of TDM results by MD Clinical Pharmacologists could represent cornerstones in improving the cost-effectiveness of an antimicrobial TDM program for emerging TDM candidates.

##中文标题- 专家临床药理学建议可使新候选患者的抗微生物TDM项目在危重患者的个体化治疗中更具临床实用性

**摘要**

背景：治疗药物监测(TDM)可能是败血症患者优化抗微生物治疗的宝贵工具，但是广泛使用受到障碍的负担。本研究的目的是评估新建立的专家临床药理学建议(ECPA)项目对改善现有TDM项目的临床有效性的影响，该项目是为危重患者量身定制抗微生物治疗的新候选者。

方法：这项回顾性观察性研究包括一个组织阶段(OP)和一个评估阶段(AP)。在OP期间（2021年1-6月），MD临床药理学家与生物分析专家、临床工程师和ICU临床医生一起组织了具体措施。在AP期间（2021年7月至12月），评估了这些措施对重症患者优化抗生素治疗的影响。确定了TDM-引导的实时ECPA程序的4个绩效指标[2021年7月-12月总TDM-引导的ECPA/2020年7月-12月总TDM结果；首次评估和总体评估时的总ECPA剂量调整/总递送ECPA；ECPA的周转时间(TAT)，定义为最佳(< 12h)，准最佳(12-24h)，可接受(24-48h)，次优(> 48h)]。

结果：OP允许实施新的组织程序，在内部网络系统创建专用途径，提供抗菌药物临床药理学教育网络研讨会，并在早晨床边ICU会议上建立多学科团队。在AP中，为166例重症患者优化261个疗程的抗菌治疗，共计提供了640份ECPA。ECPA主要涉及哌拉西林-他唑巴坦(41.8%)和美罗培南(24.9%)，其他抗菌药也有≥10种ECPA（头孢他啶、环丙沙星、氟康唑、更昔洛韦、左氧氟沙星和利奈唑胺）。总体而言，TDM活性在给药前和给药后增加了13.3倍。首次评估时，61.7%的ECPA（增加10.7%，降低51.0%）和总体45.0%的ECPA（增加10.0%，降低35.0%）推荐TDM指导的剂量调整。总体中位TAT为最佳(7.7h)，每种单药的TAT始终为最佳或准最佳。

结论：多学科方法和MD临床药理学家对TDM结果的及时专家解释可成为提高新TDM候选者抗微生物TDM项目成本效益的基础。

## The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: With ICU mortality rates decreasing, it is increasingly important to identify interventions to minimize functional impairments and improve outcomes for survivors. Simultaneously, we must identify robust patient-centered functional outcomes for our trials. Our objective was to investigate the clinimetric properties of a progression of three outcome measures, from strength to function. 

METHODS: Adults (≥ 18 years) enrolled in five international ICU rehabilitation studies. Participants required ICU admission were mechanically ventilated and previously independent. Outcomes included two components of the Physical Function in ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s): knee extensor strength and assistance required to move from sit to stand (STS); the 30-s STS (30 s STS) test was the third outcome. We analyzed survivors at ICU and hospital discharge. We report participant demographics, baseline characteristics, and outcome data using descriptive statistics. Floor effects represented ≥ 15% of participants with minimum score and ceiling effects ≥ 15% with maximum score. We calculated the overall group difference score (hospital discharge score minus ICU discharge) for participants with paired assessments. 

RESULTS: Of 451 participants, most were male (n = 278, 61.6%) with a median age between 60 and 66 years, a mean APACHE II score between 19 and 24, a median duration of mechanical ventilation between 4 and 8 days, ICU length of stay (LOS) between 7 and 11 days, and hospital LOS between 22 and 31 days. For knee extension, we observed a ceiling effect in 48.5% (160/330) of participants at ICU discharge and in 74.7% (115/154) at hospital discharge; the median [1st, 3rd quartile] PFIT-s difference score (n = 139) was 0 [0,1] (p < 0.05). For STS assistance, we observed a ceiling effect in 45.9% (150/327) at ICU discharge and in 77.5% (79/102) at hospital discharge; the median PFIT-s difference score (n = 87) was 1 [0, 2] (p < 0.05). For 30 s STS, we observed a floor effect in 15.0% (12/80) at ICU discharge but did not observe a floor or ceiling effect at hospital discharge. The median 30 s STS difference score (n = 54) was 3 [1, 6] (p < 0.05). 

CONCLUSION: Among three progressive outcome measures evaluated in this study, the 30 s STS test appears to have the most favorable clinimetric properties to assess function at ICU and hospital discharge in moderate to severely ill participants.

##中文标题- 坐立试验作为重症监护研究中以患者为中心的功能性结局：5项国际康复研究的汇总分析

**摘要**

背景：随着ICU死亡率的降低，确定干预措施以尽量减少功能障碍并改善存活者的结局变得越来越重要。同时，我们必须为我们的试验确定稳健的以患者为中心的功能性结局。我们的目的是研究三种结局指标进展的临床特征，从强度到功能。

方法：入选5项国际ICU康复研究的成人（≥18岁）。受试者需要入住ICU接受机械通气，以前是独立的。结果包括ICU测试评分的身体功能的两个部分(PFIT-s)：膝伸肌力量和从坐立位转移到站立位所需的辅助(STS)；30-s STS(30s STS)测试是第三个结果。我们分析了ICU和出院时的存活者。我们使用描述性统计报告受试者的人口统计学、基线特征和结局数据。≥15%的受试者的最低得分是地板效应，最高得分是天花板效应≥15%。我们通过配对评估计算了受试者的总体组间差异评分（出院评分减去ICU出院评分）。

结果：在451例参与者中，大多数为男性(n = 278，61.6%)，中位年龄为60-66岁，平均APACHE II评分为19-24，中位机械通气持续时间为4-8天，ICU住院时间(LOS)为7-11天，住院LOS为22-31天。对于膝关节伸展，我们观察到48.5%(160/330)的参与者在ICU出院时和74.7%(115/154)的参与者在出院时存在上限效应；中位[第1、3四分位数]PFIT-s差异评分(n = 139)为0[0,1](p < 0.05)。对于STS辅助，我们观察到在离开ICU时45.9%(150/327)存在上限效应，在出院时77.5%(79/102)存在上限效应；中位PFIT-s差异评分(n = 87)为1[0，2](p < 0.05)。对于30s的STS，我们在ICU出院时观察到15.0%(12/80)的地板效应，但在出院时未观察到地板或天花板效应。中位30s STS差异评分(n = 54)为3[1，6](p < 0.05)。

结论：在本研究评估的3个进行性结局指标中，30 sSTS检测似乎具有最有利的临床特性来评估中至重度患者在ICU和出院时的功能。

## Comparison of 6-month outcomes of sepsis versus non-sepsis critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Data on long-term outcomes after sepsis-associated critical illness have mostly come from small cohort studies, with no information about the incidence of new disability. We investigated whether sepsis-associated critical illness was independently associated with new disability at 6 months after ICU admission compared with other types of critical illness. 

METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective cohort study in six metropolitan intensive care units in Australia. Adult patients were eligible if they had been admitted to the ICU and received more than 24 h of mechanical ventilation. There was no intervention. 

RESULTS: The primary outcome was new disability measured with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS) 12 level score compared between baseline and 6 months. Between enrollment and follow-up at 6 months, 222/888 (25%) patients died, 100 (35.5%) with sepsis and 122 (20.1%) without sepsis (P < 0.001). Among survivors, there was no difference for the incidence of new disability at 6 months with or without sepsis, 42/106 (39.6%) and 106/300 (35.3%) (RD, 0.00 (- 10.29 to 10.40), P = 0.995), respectively. In addition, there was no difference in the severity of disability, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, return to work, financial distress or cognitive function. 

CONCLUSIONS: Compared to mechanically ventilated patients of similar acuity and length of stay without sepsis, patients with sepsis admitted to ICU have an increased risk of death, but survivors have a similar risk of new disability at 6 months.

##中文标题- 接受机械通气的败血症重症患者与非败血症重症患者的6个月结局比较

**摘要**

背景：脓毒血症相关危重症的长期结局数据大多来自小型队列研究，没有关于新发残疾发生率的信息。我们研究了与其他类型的危重疾病相比，脓毒症相关的危重疾病是否与入住ICU后6个月的新发残疾独立相关。

方法：我们在澳大利亚的6个大都市重症监护室进行了一项多中心、前瞻性队列研究的次要分析。成人患者如果已经进入ICU并接受超过24h的机械通气，则有资格参与研究。未进行干预。

结果：主要结局是与基线和6个月相比，使用WHO残疾评估计划2.0(WHODAS)12水平评分测量的新发残疾。在入组和6个月随访之间，222/888(25%)例患者死亡，100例(35.5%)发生败血症，122例(20.1%)未发生败血症(P < 0.001)。在存活者中，6个月时有或无败血症的新发残疾发生率无差异，分别为42/106(39.6%)和106/300(35.3%)（RD，0.00（-10.29至10.40），P = 0.995）。此外，残疾的严重程度、健康相关生活质量、焦虑和抑郁、创伤后应激、恢复工作、经济窘迫或认知功能无差异。

结论：与急性程度和无败血症住院时间相似的机械通气患者相比，入住ICU的败血症患者死亡风险增加，但存活者6个月时新发残疾风险相似。

## Impact of dexamethasone on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: a propensity-matched cohort study

**Abstract**

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of treatment with steroids on the incidence and outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Propensity-matched retrospective cohort study from February 24 to December 31, 2020, in 4 dedicated COVID-19 Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Lombardy (Italy). PATIENTS: Adult consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were subdivided into two groups: (1) treated with low-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 6 mg/day intravenous for 10 days) (DEXA+); (2) not treated with corticosteroids (DEXA-). A propensity score matching procedure (1:1 ratio) identified patients' cohorts based on: age, weight, PEEP Level, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), C reactive protein plasma concentration at admission, sex and admission hospital (exact matching). INTERVENTION: Dexamethasone 6 mg/day intravenous for 10 days from hospital admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 

RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-nine patients were included, and the propensity-score matching identified two groups of 158 subjects each. Eighty-nine (56%) DEXA+ versus 55 (34%) DEXA- patients developed a VAP (RR 1.61 (1.26-2.098), p = 0.0001), after similar time from hospitalization, ICU admission and intubation. DEXA+ patients had higher crude VAP incidence rate (49.58 (49.26-49.91) vs. 31.65 (31.38-31.91)VAP*1000/pd), (IRR 1.57 (1.55-1.58), p < 0.0001) and risk for VAP (HR 1.81 (1.31-2.50), p = 0.0003), with longer ICU LOS and invasive mechanical ventilation but similar mortality (RR 1.17 (0.85-1.63), p = 0.3332). VAPs were similarly due to G+ bacteria (mostly Staphylococcus aureus) and G- bacteria (mostly Enterobacterales). Forty-one (28%) VAPs were due to multi-drug resistant bacteria. VAP was associated with almost doubled ICU and hospital LOS and invasive mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality (RR 1.64 [1.02-2.65], p = 0.040) with no differences among patients' groups. 

CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients are at high risk for VAP, frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, and the risk is increased by corticosteroid treatment.

## Recombinant ACE2 protein protects against acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both clinical data and animal experiments suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a crucial negative regulator of RAS. Recombinant ACE2 protein (rACE2) has been demonstrated to play protective role against SARS-CoV and avian influenza-induced ALI, and more relevant, rACE2 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro. However, whether rACE2 protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI in animal models and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. 

METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein aggravated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice. SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein directly binds and downregulated ACE2, leading to an elevation in angiotensin (Ang) II. AngII further increased the NOX1/2 through AT(1)R, subsequently causing oxidative stress and uncontrolled inflammation and eventually resulting in ALI/ARDS. Importantly, rACE2 remarkably reversed SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein-induced ALI by directly binding SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein, cleaving AngI or cleaving AngII. 

CONCLUSION: This study is the first to prove that rACE2 plays a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein-aggravated LPS-induced ALI in an animal model and illustrate the mechanism by which the ACE2-AngII-AT(1)R-NOX1/2 axis might contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI.

##中文标题- 重组ACE2蛋白对SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD蛋白诱导的急性肺损伤的保护作用

**摘要**

背景：SARS-CoV-2感染导致急性肺损伤(ALI)和急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)。临床数据和动物实验均表明，肾素-血管紧张素系统(RAS)参与了SARS-CoV-2诱导的ALI的发病机制。血管紧张素转换酶2(ACE2)是SARS-CoV-2的功能性受体，也是RAS的关键负性调节因子。已证实重组ACE2蛋白(rACE2)对SARS-CoV和禽流感诱导的ALI具有保护作用，更相关的是，rACE2在体外抑制SARS-CoV-2增殖。然而，rACE2在动物模型中是否对SARS-CoV-2诱导的ALI有保护作用及其潜在的机制尚未阐明。

方法和结果：这里，我们证实SARS-CoV-2刺突受体结合域(RBD)蛋白加重脂多糖(LPS)诱导的小鼠ALI。SARS-CoV-2刺突RBD蛋白直接结合并下调ACE2，导致血管紧张素(Ang)II升高。AngII通过AT(1)R进一步增加NOX1/2，随后引起氧化应激和不受控制的炎症，最终导致ALI/ARDS。重要的是，rACE2通过直接结合SARS-CoV-2刺突RBD蛋白、裂解AngI或裂解AngII显著逆转SARS-CoV-2刺突RBD蛋白诱导的ALI。

结论：本研究首次证实rACE2在动物模型中对SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD蛋白加重的LPS诱导的ALI起保护作用，并阐明ACE2-AngII-AT(1)R-NOX1/2轴可能导致SARS-CoV-2诱导的ALI的机制。

## Early versus delayed enteral nutrition in mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory shock: a nested cohort analysis of an international multicenter, pragmatic clinical trial

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence on the timing and efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) practices in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with circulatory shock is limited. We hypothesized early EN (EEN), as compared to delayed EN (DEN), is associated with improved clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with circulatory shock. 

METHODS: We analyzed a dataset from an international, multicenter, pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating protein dose in ICU patients. Data were collected from ICU admission, and EEN was defined as initiating < 48 h from ICU admission and DEN > 48 h. We identified MV patients in circulatory shock to evaluate the association between the timing of EN initiation and clinical outcomes. The regression analysis model controlled for age, mNUTRIC score, APACHE II score, sepsis, and Site. 

RESULTS: We included 626 patients, from 52 ICUs in 14 countries. Median age was 60 years [18-93], 55% had septic shock, 99% received norepinephrine alone, 91% received EN alone, and 50.3% were randomized to a usual protein dose. Forty-two percent of EEN patients had persistent organ dysfunction syndrome plus death at day 28, compared to 53% in the DEN group (p = 0.04). EEN was associated with more ICU-free days (9.3 ± 9.2 vs. 5.7 ± 7.9, p = 0.0002), more days alive and free of vasopressors (7.1 ± 3.1 vs. 6.3 ± 3.2, p = 0.007), and shorter duration of MV among survivors (9.8 ± 10.9 vs. 13.8 ± 14.5, p = 0.0002). This trend was no longer observed in the adjusted analysis. There were no differences in ICU/60-day mortality or feeding intolerance rates between groups. 

CONCLUSION: In MV patients with circulatory shock, EEN, as compared to DEN, was associated with improved clinical outcomes, but no longer when adjusting for illness severity. RCTs comparing the efficacy of EEN to DEN in MV patients with circulatory shock are warranted.

##中文标题- 早期与延迟肠内营养在机械通气的循环性休克患者中的应用：一项国际多中心、实用临床试验的巢式队列分析

**摘要**

引言：有关伴有循环性休克的重症监护室(ICU)患者中肠内营养(EN)实践的时间和有效性的真实证据有限。我们假设与延迟EN(DEN)相比，早期EN(EEN)与机械通气(MV)的循环性休克患者的临床结局改善相关。

方法：我们分析了一项评估ICU患者蛋白质剂量的国际、多中心、实用随机临床试验(RCT)的数据集。数据收集自ICU入院，EEN定义为从ICU入院<48 h开始，DEN>48 h。我们确定了循环休克的MV患者，以评价EN开始时间与临床结局之间的相关性。回归分析模型控制了年龄、mNUTRIC评分、APACHE II评分、败血症和部位。

结果：我们纳入了来自14个国家52间ICU的626例患者。中位年龄为60岁[18-93]，55%的患者患有感染性休克，99%的患者仅接受去甲肾上腺素治疗，91%的患者仅接受EN治疗，50.3%的患者随机接受常用的蛋白质剂量。42%的EEN患者在第28天有持续性器官功能障碍综合征加死亡，而DEN组为53%(p = 0.04)。EEN组无ICU天数更多(9.3±9.2 vs. 5.7±7.9，p = 0.0002)、存活和无血管加压素天数更多(7.1±3.1 vs. 6.3±3.2，p = 0.007)、存活者的MV持续时间更短(9.8±10.9 vs. 13.8±14.5，p = 0.0002)。在校正分析中不再观察到该趋势。治疗组间ICU/60天死亡率或喂养不耐受率无差异。

结论：在伴有循环性休克的MV患者中，与DEN相比，EEN与临床结局改善相关，但在校正疾病严重程度时不再相关。有必要进行RCT，在伴有循环性休克的MV患者中比较EEN与DEN的疗效。

## Pentraxin-3 as a predictive marker of mortality in sepsis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to clarify the prognostic value of Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) on the mortality of patients with sepsis. 

METHODS: Publications published up to January 2021 were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Data from eligible cohort and case-control studies were extracted for the meta-analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation of the outcomes with sample size and male proportion. 

RESULTS: A total of 17 studies covering 3658 sepsis patients were included. PTX3 level was significantly higher in non-survivor compared to survivor patients (SMD (95% CI): -1.06 (-1.43, -0.69), P < 0.001). Increased PTX3 level was significantly associated with mortality (HR (95% CI): 2.09 (1.55, 2.81), P < 0.001). PTX3 showed good predictive capability for mortality (AUC:ES (95% CI): 0.73 (0.70, 0.77), P < 0.001). The outcome comparing PTX3 level in non-survivors vs. survivors and the outcome of the association between PTX3 and mortality were associated with sample size but not male proportion. AUC was associated with both sample size and male proportion. 

CONCLUSIONS: PTX3 level was significantly higher in non-survivor compared to survivor patients with sepsis. Elevated PTX3 level was significantly associated with mortality. Furthermore, the level of PTX3 might predict patient mortality.

##中文标题- Pentraxin-3作为脓毒症死亡率的预测指标：一项更新的系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：本研究的目的是阐明正五聚蛋白-3(PTX3)对脓毒症患者死亡率的预后价值。

方法：对PubMed、EMBASE和Cochrane library中截至2021年1月发表的出版物进行了检索。从符合条件的队列研究和病例对照研究中提取数据进行荟萃分析。采用多变量回归分析评价了结局与样本量和男性比例的相关性。

结果：共纳入17项研究，涵盖3658例败血症患者。非存活患者的PTX3水平显著高于存活患者(SMD(95%CI)：-1.06(-1.43，-0.69)，P < 0.001)。PTX3水平升高与死亡率显著相关(HR(95%CI)：2.09(1.55，2.81)，P < 0.001)。PTX3对死亡率具有良好的预测能力(AUC：ES(95%CI)：0.73(0.70，0.77)，P < 0.001)。比较非存活者与存活者PTX3水平的结果以及PTX3与死亡率之间相关性的结果与样本量有关，但与男性比例无关。AUC与样本量和男性比例均相关。

结论：非存活者的PTX3水平显著高于败血症存活者。PTX3水平升高与死亡率显著相关。此外，PTX3的水平可能预测患者的死亡率。

## Resilience is a dirty word: misunderstood, and how we can truly build it

**Abstract**

Resilience is ubiquitous in everyday speech, academic literature and governmental policies. Yet it seems to have taken a narrow scope in healthcare, confined to individual and psychological resilience. This short essay aims to broaden the understanding of resilience to organisational levels and calls intensivists to take active roles in fostering resilience for their staff. The article explores firstly the background and etymology of resilience. It then challenges current approaches and briefly signposts some current work in the area. Some examples of structural factors which build individual resilience are listed, followed by a call for intensivists to take active roles to build future resilience. The need for interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral and multi-level approaches is vital to build future healthcare resilience, and we intensivists must continue to be advocates for systemic change.

## Early intubation and patient-centered outcomes in septic shock: a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter study

**Abstract**

PURPOSE: Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilation, its use in critically ill patients is associated with complications and had led to the growth of noninvasive techniques. We assessed the effect of early intubation (first 8 h after vasopressor start) in septic shock patients, as compared to non-early intubated subjects (unexposed), regarding in-hospital mortality, intensive care and hospital length of stay. 

METHODS: This study involves secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective study. To adjust for baseline differences in potential confounders, propensity score matching was carried out. In-hospital mortality was analyzed in a time-to-event fashion, while length of stay was assessed as a median difference using bootstrapping. 

RESULTS: A total of 735 patients (137 intubated in the first 8 h) were evaluated. Propensity score matching identified 78 pairs with similar severity and characteristics on admission. Intubation was used in all patients in the early intubation group and in 27 (35%) subjects beyond 8 h in the unexposed group. Mortality occurred in 35 (45%) and in 26 (33%) subjects in the early intubation and unexposed groups (hazard ratio 1.44 95% CI 0.86-2.39, p = 0.16). ICU and hospital length of stay were not different among groups [9 vs. 5 (95% CI 1 to 7) and 14 vs. 16 (95% CI - 7 to 8) days]. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings. 

CONCLUSIONS: An early approach to invasive mechanical ventilation did not improve outcomes in this matched cohort of patients. The limited number of patients included in these analyses out the total number included in the study may limit generalizability of these findings.

##中文标题- 脓毒性休克的早期插管和以患者为中心的结局：前瞻性多中心研究的次要分析

**摘要**

目的：尽管机械通气具有获益，但其在重症患者中的使用与并发症相关，并导致了无创技术的发展。我们评估了与非早期插管受试者（未暴露）相比，早期插管（血管加压素开始后前8h）对感染性休克患者住院死亡率、重症监护和住院时间的影响。

方法：本研究涉及一项多中心前瞻性研究的二次分析。为了校正潜在混杂因素的基线差异，进行倾向评分匹配。采用至事件发生时间的方式分析了住院死亡率，而采用拔靴法将住院时间评估为中位差异。

结果：共评价了735例患者（前8h内插管137例）。倾向评分匹配确定了78对入院时严重程度和特征相似的受试者。早期插管组的所有患者和未暴露组超过8 h的27名(35%)受试者使用插管。早期插管组和未暴露组中分别有35名(45%)和26名(33%)受试者死亡（风险比1.44 95%CI 0.86-2.39，p = 0.16）。各组间ICU和住院时间无差异[9 vs. 5(95%CI 1-7)和14 vs. 16(95%CI 7-8)天]。所有敏感性分析均证实了我们结果的稳健性。

结论：在该匹配的患者队列中，有创机械通气的早期方法未改善结局。这些分析中纳入的患者数量有限，超出了研究纳入的总数量，可能限制这些结果的普遍性。

## Baseline plasma IL-18 may predict simvastatin treatment response in patients with ARDS: a secondary analysis of the HARP-2 randomised clinical trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-18 is a marker of inflammasome activation, and high baseline plasma IL-18 is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. The aim of this analysis was to determine if simvastatin was associated with benefit in patients with ARDS and high plasma IL-18. 

METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the HARP-2 study, we compared 28-day mortality and response to simvastatin according to baseline plasma IL-18 using cox proportional hazards analysis. Separately, monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy volunteers were pre-incubated with simvastatin or rosuvastatin before stimulation with ATP and LPS, and the effect on secreted IL-18 and IL-1β compared. 

RESULTS: 511 patients from HARP-2 had available data. High baseline plasma IL-18 (≥ 800 pg/ml) was associated with increased 28-day mortality (high IL-18 30.6% vs. low IL-18 17.5%; HR 1.89 [95% CI 1.30-2.73]; p = 0.001). Allocation to simvastatin in patients with high baseline plasma IL-18 was associated with a lower probability of 28-day mortality compared with placebo (24.0% vs 36.8%; p = 0.01). Finally, simvastatin, but not rosuvastatin, reduced stimulated macrophage secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β. 

CONCLUSION: In patients with high baseline plasma IL-18, simvastatin is associated with a higher probability of survival, and this effect may be due to reduced inflammasome activation. These data suggest that baseline plasma IL-18 may allow a personalised treatment approach by identifying patients with ARDS who could benefit from simvastatin therapy.

##中文标题- 基线血浆IL-18可预测辛伐他汀治疗ARDS患者的应答：HARP-2随机临床试验的次要分析

**摘要**

背景：白介素(IL)-18是炎性体激活的标志物，高基线血浆IL-18与脓毒症诱导的ARDS患者死亡率增加相关。本分析的目的是确定辛伐他汀是否与ARDS伴高血浆IL-18患者的获益相关。

方法：在HARP-2研究的二次分析中，我们使用cox比例风险分析根据基线血浆IL-18比较了辛伐他汀的28天死亡率和应答。分别将来自健康志愿者的单核细胞源性巨噬细胞与ATP和LPS刺激前的辛伐他汀或瑞舒伐他汀预孵育，比较对分泌的IL-18和IL-1β的影响。

结果：来自HARP-2的511名患者具有可用数据。高基线血浆IL-18(≥800 pg/mL)与28天死亡率增加相关（高IL-18 30.6%对比低IL-18 17.5%；HR 1.89[95%CI 1.30-2.73]；p = 0.001）。与安慰剂组相比，基线血浆IL-18较高的患者中，辛伐他汀组的28天死亡率较低(24.0%vs 36.8%；p = 0.01)。最后，辛伐他汀（而不是瑞舒伐他汀）减少了刺激的巨噬细胞分泌IL-18和IL-1β。

结论：在基线血浆IL-18较高的患者中，辛伐他汀与较高的生存概率相关，这种影响可能是由于减少了炎症小体激活。这些数据表明，通过识别可从辛伐他汀治疗获益的ARDS患者，基线血浆IL-18可能允许采用个体化治疗方法。

## An interventional quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact of a rapid screening strategy in improving control of nosocomial extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales and carbapenemase-producing organisms in critically ill patients

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Rapid molecular tests could accelerate the control of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) and carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) in intensive care units (ICUs). OBJECTIVE AND 

METHODS: This interventional 12-month cohort study compared a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay performed directly on rectal swabs with culturing methods (control period, 6 months), during routine ICU screening. Contact precautions (CP) were implemented for CPO or non-E. coli ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (nEcESBL-PE) carriers. Using survival analysis, we compared the time intervals from admission to discontinuation of unnecessary preemptive CP among patients at-risk and the time intervals from screening to implementation of CP among newly identified carriers. We also compared diagnostic performances, and nEcESBL-PE/CPO acquisition rates. This study is registered, ISRCTN 23588440. 

RESULTS: We included 1043 patients. During the intervention and control phases, 92/147 (62.6%) and 47/86 (54.7%) of patients at-risk screened at admission were candidates for early discontinuation of preemptive CP. The LAMP assay had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.9% for CPO, and 55.6% PPV and 98.2% NPV for nEcESBL-PE. Due to result notification and interpretation challenges, the median time from admission to discontinuation of preemptive CP increased during the interventional period from 80.5 (95% CI 71.5-132.1) to 88.3 (95% CI 57.7-103.7) hours (p = 0.47). Due to the poor PPV, we had to stop using the LAMP assay to implement CP. No difference was observed regarding the incidence of nEcESBL-PE and CPO acquisition. 

CONCLUSION: A rapid screening strategy with LAMP assays performed directly on rectal swabs had no benefit for infection control in a low-endemicity setting.

##中文标题- 一项干预性准实验研究，旨在评价快速筛查策略对改善危重患者院内产超广谱β-内酰胺酶肠杆菌科细菌和产碳青霉烯酶微生物控制的影响

**摘要**

引言：快速分子检测可加速控制重症监护室(ICU)产超广谱β-内酰胺酶肠杆菌科细菌(ESBL-PE)和产碳青霉烯酶微生物(CPO)。目的和

方法：这项干预性12个月队列研究比较了在常规ICU筛查期间，用培养方法直接对直肠拭子进行的环介导等温扩增(LAMP)试验（对照期，6个月）。对CPO或非大肠杆菌产ESBL肠杆菌(nEcESBL-PE)携带者采取接触预防措施(CP)。使用生存分析，我们比较了高危患者从入院到停止不必要的先发制人CP的时间间隔和新发现携带者从筛选到实施CP的时间间隔。我们还比较了诊断性能和nEcESBL-PE/CPO采集率。本研究已注册，ISRCTN 23588440。

结果：我们纳入了1043例患者。在干预和控制阶段，92/147(62.6%)和47/86(54.7%)入院时筛查的高危患者是提前中止先驱CP的候选者。LAMP检测对CPO的阳性预测值(PPV)为44.0%，阴性预测值(NPV)为99.9%，对nEcESBL-PE的阳性预测值(PPV)为55.6%，阴性预测值(NPV)为98.2%。由于结果通知和解释困难，在干预期间，从入院至停用预防性CP的中位时间从80.5(95%CI 71.5-132.1)小时增加至88.3(95%CI 57.7-103.7)小时(p = 0.47)。由于PPV较差，我们不得不停止使用LAMP试验实施CP。未观察到nEcESBL-PE和CPO获得的发生率差异。

结论：直接在直肠拭子上进行LAMP检测的快速筛查策略在低流行环境中对感染控制无获益。

## Respiratory distress observation scales to predict weaning outcome

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Whether dyspnea is present before starting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and whether it may affect the outcome of the SBT is unknown. Mechanical Ventilation-Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) has been proposed as a reliable surrogate of dyspnea in non-communicative intubated patients. In the present study, we sought (1) to describe the evolution of the MV-RDOS during a SBT and (2) to investigate whether MV-RDOS can predict the outcome of the SBT. 

METHODS: Prospective, single-center study in a twenty-two bed ICU in a tertiary center. Patients intubated since more 48 h who had failed a first SBT were eligible if they meet classical readiness to wean criteria. The MV-RDOS was assessed before, at 2-min, 15-min and 30-min (end) of the SBT. The presence of clinically important dyspnea was inferred by a MV-RDOS value ≥ 2.6. 

RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (age 63 [51-70], SAPS II 66 [51-76]; med [IQR]) were included. Thirty-three (57%) patients failed the SBT, whose 18 (55%) failed before 15-min. Twenty-five (43%) patients successfully passed the SBT. A MV-RDOS ≥ 2.6 was present in ten (17%) patients before to start the SBT. All these ten patients subsequently failed the SBT. A MV-RDOS ≥ 2.6 at 2-min predicted a SBT failure with a 51% sensibility and a 88% specificity (AUC 0.741 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.616-0.866, p = 0.002). Best cut-off value at 2-min was 4.3 and predicted SBT failure with a 27% sensibility and a 96% specificity. 

CONCLUSION: Despite patients met classical readiness to wean criteria, respiratory distress assessed with the MV-RDOS was frequent at the beginning of SBT. Measuring MV-RDOS before to initiate a SBT could avoid undue procedure and reduce patient's exposure to unnecessary mechanical ventilation weaning failure and distress.

##中文标题- 呼吸窘迫观察量表预测撤机结局

**摘要**

背景：尚不清楚在开始自主呼吸试验(SBT)之前是否存在呼吸困难，是否可能影响SBT的结局。机械通气-呼吸窘迫观察量表(MV-RDOS)已被提出作为非沟通插管患者呼吸困难的可靠替代。在本研究中，我们试图(1)描述SBT期间MV-RDOS的演变，(2)研究MV-RDOS是否可以预测SBT的结局。

方法：前瞻性、单中心研究，在三级中心的22张病床ICU中进行。首次SBT失败后超过48h插管的患者，如果符合经典的准备断奶标准，则有资格参与研究。在SBT前、2 min、15 min和30 min（结束）时评估MV-RDOS。通过MV-RDOS值≥2.6推断出现具有临床意义的呼吸困难。

结果：纳入58例患者（年龄63[51-70]，SAPS II 66[51-76]；中位数[IQR]）。33例(57%)患者SBT失败，其中18例(55%)在15 min前失败。25例(43%)患者成功通过SBT。在开始SBT前，10例(17%)患者的MV-RDOS≥2.6。所有这10例患者随后的SBT均失败。2 min时MV-RDOS≥2.6预测SBT失败的敏感性为51%，特异性为88%（AUC 0.741 95%置信区间[CI]0.616-0.866，p = 0.002）。2 min时的最佳临界值为4.3，预测SBT失败的敏感性为27%，特异性为96%。

结论：尽管患者符合经典的准备脱机标准，但在SBT开始时，使用MV-RDOS评估的呼吸窘迫较为频繁。在开始SBT前测量MV-RDOS可避免不适当的程序，并减少患者暴露于不必要的机械通气撤机失败和痛苦。

## Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: echocardiography predictors of clinical deterioration

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: We determine the predictive value of transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) metrics for clinical deterioration within 5 days in adults with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). 

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of intermediate-risk PE patients. To determine associations of TTE and clinical predictors with clinical deterioration, we used univariable analysis, Youden's index for optimal thresholds, and multivariable analyses to report odds ratios (ORs) or area under the curve (AUC). 

RESULTS: Of 306 intermediate-risk PE patients, 115 (37.6%) experienced clinical deterioration. PE patients who had clinical deterioration within 5 days had greater baseline right ventricle (RV) dilatation and worse systolic function than the group without clinical deterioration as indicated by the following: RV basal diameter 4.46 ± 0.77 versus 4.20 ± 0.77 cm; RV/LV basal width ratio 1.14 ± 0.29 versus 1.02 ± 0.24; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 1.56 ± 0.55 versus 1.80 ± 0.52 cm; and RV systolic excursion velocity 10.40 ± 3.58 versus 12.1 ± 12.5 cm/s, respectively. Optimal thresholds for predicting clinical deterioration were: RV basal width 3.9 cm (OR 2.85 [1.64, 4.97]), RV-to-left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio 1.08 (OR 3.32 [2.07, 5.33]), TAPSE 1.98 cm (OR 3.3 [2.06, 5.3]), systolic excursion velocity 10.10 cm/s (OR 2.85 [1.75, 4.63]), and natriuretic peptide 190 pg/mL (OR 2.89 [1.81, 4.62]). Significant independent predictors were: transient hypotension 6.1 (2.2, 18.9), highest heart rate 1.02 (1.00, 1.03), highest respiratory rate 1.02 (1.00, 1.04), and RV/LV ratio 1.29 (1.14, 1.47). By logistic regression and random forest analyses, AUCs were 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) and 0.78 (0.70, 0.85), respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS: Basal RV, RV/LV ratio, and RV systolic function measurements were significantly different between intermediate-risk PE patients grouped by subsequent clinical deterioration.

##中文标题- 中度风险肺栓塞：超声心动图预测临床恶化

**摘要**

背景：我们确定了经胸超声心动图(TTE)指标对中危肺栓塞(PE)成人患者5天内临床恶化的预测价值。

方法：这是一项针对中危PE患者的前瞻性观察研究。为了确定TTE和临床预测指标与临床恶化的相关性，我们使用单变量分析、Youden指数作为最佳阈值，并使用多变量分析来报告比值比(OR)或曲线下面积(AUC)。

结果：在306例中危PE患者中，115例(37.6%)发生临床恶化。在5天内发生临床恶化的PE患者比无临床恶化组具有更大的基线右心室(RV)扩张和更差的收缩功能，如下所示：RV基底直径4.46±0.77 vs 4.20±0.77 cm；RV/LV基底宽度比1.14±0.29 vs 1.02±0.24；三尖瓣环平面收缩期偏移(TAPSE)分别为1.56±0.55和1.80±0.52 cm；RV收缩期偏移速度分别为10.40±3.58和12.1±12.5 cm/s。预测临床恶化的最佳阈值为：RV基底宽度3.9 cm(OR 2.85[1.64，4.97])，RV与左心室(RV/LV)比率1.08(OR 3.32[2.07，5.33])，TAPSE 1.98 cm(OR 3.3[2.06，5.3])，收缩偏移速度10.10 cm/s(OR 2.85[1.75，4.63])和利钠肽190 pg/mL(OR 2.89[1.81，4.62])。显著的独立预测因素为：一过性低血压6.1(2.2，18.9)、最高心率1.02(1.00，1.03)、最高呼吸率1.02(1.00，1.04)和RV/LV比值1.29(1.14，1.47)。通过logistic回归和随机森林分析，AUC分别为0.80(0.73，0.87)和0.78(0.70，0.85)。

结论：根据后续临床恶化分组，中度风险PE患者之间的基础RV、RV/LV比率和RV收缩功能测量值存在显著差异。

## Association of annual hospital septic shock case volume and hospital mortality

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The burden of sepsis remains high in China. The relationship between case volume and hospital mortality among patients with septic shock, the most severe complication of sepsis, is unknown in China. 

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed surveillance data from a national quality improvement program in intensive care units (ICUs) in China in 2020. Association between septic shock case volume and hospital mortality was analyzed using multivariate linear regression and restricted cubic splines. 

RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 134,046 septic shock cases in ICUs from 1902 hospitals in China during 2020. In this septic shock cohort, the median septic shock volume per hospital was 33 cases (interquartile range 14-76 cases), 41.4% were female, and more than half of the patients were over 61 years old, with average hospital mortality of 21.2%. An increase in case volume was associated with improved survival among septic shock cases. In the linear regression model, the highest quartile of septic shock volume was associated with lower hospital mortality compared with the lowest quartile (β - 0.86; 95% CI - 0.98, - 0.74; p < 0.001). Similar differences were found in hospitals of respective geographic locations and hospital levels. With case volume modeled as a continuous variable in a restricted cubic spline, a lower volume threshold of 40 cases before which a substantial reduction of the hospital mortality rate was observed. 

CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that hospitals with higher septic shock case volume have lower hospital mortality in China. Further research is needed to explain the mechanism of this volume-outcome relationship.

##中文标题- 每年医院感染性休克病例量与医院死亡率的相关性

**摘要**

背景：脓毒症在中国的负担仍然很高。在中国，脓毒性休克（脓毒症最严重的并发症）患者的病例数量与住院死亡率之间的关系未知。

方法：在这项回顾性队列研究中，我们分析了2020年中国重症监护室(ICU)国家质量改进计划的监测数据。使用多变量线性回归和约束三次样条分析脓毒性休克病例体积与住院死亡率之间的相关性。

结果：我们于2020年在中国1902家医院的ICU共入组了134,046例感染性休克病例。在该脓毒性休克队列中，每家医院的脓毒性休克体积中位数为33例（四分位距14-76例），41.4%为女性，超过一半的患者年龄超过61岁，平均住院死亡率为21.2%。脓毒性休克病例中，病例量增加与生存率改善相关。在线性回归模型中，与最低四分位数相比，脓毒性休克体积的最高四分位数与较低的住院死亡率相关(β-0.86；95%CI-0.98，-0.74；p < 0.001)。在各地理位置和医院级别的医院中也发现了类似的差异。将病例量建模为限制性三次样条中的连续变量，40例病例的较低体积阈值之前观察到住院死亡率的大幅降低。

结论：研究结果表明，脓毒性休克病例量较高的医院在中国的医院死亡率较低。需要进一步研究来解释这种容量-结局关系的机制。

## One-year patient outcomes based on lung morphology in acute respiratory distress syndrome: secondary analysis of LIVE trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has different phenotypes and distinct short-term outcomes. Patients with non-focal ARDS have a higher short-term mortality than focal ones. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the morphological phenotypes of ARDS on long-term outcomes. 

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the LIVE study, a prospective, randomised control trial, assessing the usefulness of a personalised ventilator setting according to lung morphology in moderate-to-severe ARDS. ARDS was classified as focal (consolidations only in the infero-posterior part of the lungs) or non-focal. Outcomes were assessed using mortality and functional scores for quality of life at the 1-year follow-up. 

RESULTS: A total of 124 focal ARDS and 236 non-focal ARDS cases were included. The 1-year mortality was higher for non-focal ARDS than for focal ARDS (37% vs. 24%, p = 0.012). Non-focal ARDS (hazard ratio, 3.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-6.59; p < 0.001), age, McCabe score, haematological cancers, SAPS II, and renal replacement therapy were independently associated with 1-year mortality. This difference was driven by mortality during the first 90 days (28 vs. 16%, p = 0.010) but not between 90 days and 1 year (7 vs. 6%, p = 0.591), at which point only the McCabe score was independently associated with mortality. Morphological phenotypes had no impact on patient-reported outcomes. 

CONCLUSION: Lung morphologies reflect the acute phase of ARDS and its short-term impact but not long-term outcomes, which seem only influenced by comorbidities.

##中文标题- 急性呼吸窘迫综合征中基于肺形态学的1年患者结局：LIVE试验的次要分析

**摘要**

背景：急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)具有不同的表型和不同的短期结局。非局灶性ARDS患者的短期死亡率高于局灶性。本研究旨在评估ARDS形态学表型对长期结局的影响。

方法：这是对LIVE研究的二次分析，LIVE研究是一项前瞻性、随机对照试验，根据肺形态评估个性化呼吸机设置在中重度ARDS中的有用性。ARDS分类为局灶性（仅肺的下后部实变）或非局灶性。采用1年随访时的死亡率和生活质量功能评分评估了结局。

结果：共纳入124例局灶性ARDS和236例非局灶性ARDS病例。非局灶性ARDS的1年死亡率高于局灶性ARDS(37%vs. 24%，p = 0.012)。非局灶性ARDS（风险比，3.44；95%置信区间，1.80-6.59；p < 0.001）、年龄、McCabe评分、血液学癌症、SAPS II和肾脏替代治疗与1年死亡率独立相关。该差异由前90天期间的死亡率驱动(28 vs. 16%，p = 0.010)，但不是在90天和1年之间(7 vs. 6%，p = 0.591)，在该时间点，仅McCabe评分与死亡率独立相关。形态学表型对患者报告的结局无影响。

结论：肺形态反映了ARDS的急性期及其短期影响，而非长期结局，似乎仅受合并症的影响。

## Comparative incidence of early and late bloodstream and respiratory tract co-infection in patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia versus Influenza A or B pneumonia versus no viral pneumonia: wales multicentre ICU cohort study

**Abstract**

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to characterise early and late respiratory and bloodstream co-infection in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with SARS-CoV-2-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) needing respiratory support in seven ICUs within Wales, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare the rate of positivity of different secondary pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity in three different patient groups: patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia, Influenza A or B pneumonia, and patients without viral pneumonia. 

DESIGN: Multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study with rapid microbiology data from Public Health Wales, sharing of clinical and demographic data from seven participating ICUs. SETTING: Seven Welsh ICUs participated between 10 March and 31 July 2020. Clinical and demographic data for COVID-19 disease were shared by each participating centres, and microbiology data were extracted from a data repository within Public Health Wales. Comparative data were taken from a cohort of patients without viral pneumonia admitted to ICU during the same period as the COVID-19 cohort (referred to as no viral pneumonia or 'no viral' group), and to a retrospective non-matched cohort of consecutive patients with Influenza A or B admitted to ICUs from 20 November 2017. The comparative data for Influenza pneumonia and no viral pneumonia were taken from one of the seven participating ICUs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 299 consecutive patients admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 pneumonia were compared with 173 and 48 patients admitted with no viral pneumonia or Influenza A or B pneumonia, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was to calculate comparative incidence of early and late co-infection in patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, Influenza A or B pneumonia and no viral pneumonia. Secondary outcome was to calculate the individual group of early and late co-infection rate on a per-patient and per-sample basis, with their antimicrobial susceptibility and thirdly to ascertain any statistical correlation between clinical and demographic variables with rate of acquiring co-infection following ICU admission. 

RESULTS: A total of 299 adults (median age 57, M/F 2:1) were included in the COVID-19 ICU cohort. The incidence of respiratory and bloodstream co-infection was 40.5% and 15.1%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant bacterial pathogen within the first 48 h. Gram-negative organisms from Enterobacterales group were predominantly seen after 48 h in COVID-19 cohort. Comparative no viral pneumonia cohort had lower rates of respiratory tract infection and bloodstream infection. The influenza cohort had similar rates respiratory tract infection and bloodstream infection. Mortality in all three groups was similar, and no clinical or demographic variables were found to increase the rate of co-infection and ICU mortality. 

CONCLUSIONS: Higher incidence of bacterial co-infection was found in COVID-19 cohort as compared to the no viral pneumonia cohort admitted to ICUs for respiratory support.

##中文标题- 比较入住ICU的COVID-19肺炎患者与甲型或乙型流感肺炎患者相比无病毒性肺炎患者的早期和晚期血液和呼吸道合并感染的发生率：威尔士多中心ICU队列研究

**摘要**

目的：目的是描述在第一轮COVID-19大流行期间，威尔士7个ICU中，因SARS-CoV-2相关性急性低氧性呼吸衰竭(AHRF)而需要呼吸支持的重症监护室(ICU)患者的早期和晚期呼吸和血液混合感染。我们比较了3个不同患者组中不同次要病原体的阳性率及其抗菌敏感性：入住ICU的COVID-19肺炎患者、甲型流感或乙型肺炎患者和无病毒性肺炎患者。

设计：多中心、回顾性、观察性队列研究，快速微生物学数据来自威尔士公共卫生部，共享来自7个参与ICU的临床和人口统计学数据。设置：2020年3月10日至2020年7月31日，7间入住Welsh ICU。每个参与中心共享COVID-19疾病的临床和人口统计学数据，微生物学数据提取自Public Health Wales的一个数据储存库。比较数据来自与COVID-19队列（称为无病毒性肺炎或“无病毒性”组）相同时期内入住ICU的无病毒性肺炎的患者队列和从2017年11月20日开始入住ICU的连续甲型或乙型流感患者的回顾性非匹配队列。从7个参与ICU中的1个获得了流行性感冒肺炎和无病毒性肺炎的比较数据。参与者：对299名连续入院的COVID-19肺炎患者与173名连续入院的无病毒性肺炎或甲型流感或乙型流感肺炎的患者进行比较。主要结局指标：主要结局是计算入住ICU时有COVID-19、甲型或乙型流感肺炎和无病毒性肺炎患者的早期和晚期合并感染的比较发生率。次要结局是根据每位患者和每份样本计算早期和晚期混合感染率的个体组，以及它们的抗生素敏感性，第三是确定临床和人口统计学变量与ICU入院后获得性混合感染率之间的任何统计学相关性。

结果：COVID-19 ICU队列共纳入299例成人（中位年龄57岁，男性/女性2:1）。呼吸道和血液混合感染的发生率分别为40.5%和15.1%。金黄色葡萄球菌是第一个48h内的主要细菌性病原体。在COVID-19队列中，48h后主要观察到来自肠杆菌组的革兰氏阴性微生物。病毒性肺炎队列中呼吸道感染和血液感染的发生率较低。流感队列中呼吸道感染和血液感染的发生率相似。所有3组的死亡率相似，未发现临床或人口统计学变量增加共同感染率和ICU死亡率。

结论：COVID-19队列的细菌合并感染发生率高于入住ICU进行呼吸支持的无病毒性肺炎队列。

## Association between early cumulative fluid balance and successful liberation from invasive ventilation in COVID-19 ARDS patients - insights from the PRoVENT-COVID study: a national, multicenter, observational cohort analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates the potential benefits of restricted fluid management in critically ill patients. Evidence lacks on the optimal fluid management strategy for invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that the cumulative fluid balance would affect the successful liberation of invasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

METHODS: We analyzed data from the multicenter observational 'PRactice of VENTilation in COVID-19 patients' study. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and ARDS who required invasive ventilation during the first 3 months of the international outbreak (March 1, 2020, to June 2020) across 22 hospitals in the Netherlands were included. The primary outcome was successful liberation of invasive ventilation, modeled as a function of day 3 cumulative fluid balance using Cox proportional hazards models, using the crude and the adjusted association. Sensitivity analyses without missing data and modeling ARDS severity were performed. 

RESULTS: Among 650 patients, three groups were identified. Patients in the higher, intermediate, and lower groups had a median cumulative fluid balance of 1.98 L (1.27-7.72 L), 0.78 L (0.26-1.27 L), and - 0.35 L (- 6.52-0.26 L), respectively. Higher day 3 cumulative fluid balance was significantly associated with a lower probability of successful ventilation liberation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.95, P = 0.0047). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. 

CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, a higher cumulative fluid balance was associated with a longer ventilation duration, indicating that restricted fluid management in these patients may be beneficial.

##中文标题- COVID-19 ARDS患者中早期累积体液平衡与有创通气成功的相关性–来自PRoVENT-COVID研究的观点：一项国家、多中心、观察性队列分析

**摘要**

背景：越来越多的证据表明限制性液体管理在重症患者中的潜在获益。证据缺乏针对有创通气COVID-19患者的最佳液体管理策略。我们假设，在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者中，累积液体平衡将影响COVID-19有创通气的成功释放。

方法：我们分析了多中心观察性“COVID-19患者中的通气实践”研究的数据。纳入了荷兰22家医院在国际暴发的前3个月（2020年3月1日至2020年6月）期间需要有创通气的COVID-19和ARDS确诊患者。主要结局为成功释放有创通气，使用Cox比例风险模型（使用粗比例和调整后的相关性）作为第3天累积体液平衡的函数建模。进行敏感性分析，不包括缺失数据和ARDS严重程度建模。

结果：在650例患者中，确定了3组。较高、中等和较低组患者的中位累积液体平衡分别为1.98 L(1.27-7.72 L)、0.78 L(0.26-1.27 L)和-0.35 L(-6.52-0.26 L)。较高的第3天累积体液平衡与较低的成功通气概率显著相关（调整后风险比0.86，95%CI 0.77-0.95，P = 0.0047）。敏感性分析显示了相似的结果。

结论：在COVID-19和ARDS有创通气患者队列中，较高的累积液体平衡与较长的通气持续时间相关，表明这些患者中限制液体管理可能是有益的。

## Impairment of neutrophil functions and homeostasis in COVID-19 patients: association with disease severity

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: A dysregulated immune response is emerging as a key feature of critical illness in COVID-19. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity that, if not tightly regulated, contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation. We sought to decipher the role of neutrophil phenotypes, functions, and homeostasis in COVID-19 disease severity and outcome. 

METHODS: By using flow cytometry, this longitudinal study compares peripheral whole-blood neutrophils from 90 COVID-19 ICU patients with those of 22 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients hospitalized for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 38 healthy controls. We also assessed correlations between these phenotypic and functional indicators and markers of endothelial damage as well as disease severity. 

RESULTS: At ICU admission, the circulating neutrophils of the COVID-19 patients showed continuous basal hyperactivation not seen in CAP patients, associated with higher circulating levels of soluble E- and P-selectin, which reflect platelet and endothelial activation. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients had expanded aged-angiogenic and reverse transmigrated neutrophil subsets-both involved in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Simultaneously, COVID-19 patients had significantly lower levels of neutrophil oxidative burst in response to bacterial formyl peptide. Moreover patients dying of COVID-19 had significantly higher expansion of aged-angiogenic neutrophil subset and greater impairment of oxidative burst response than survivors. 

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neutrophil exhaustion may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify angiogenic neutrophils as a potentially harmful subset involved in fatal outcome.

##中文标题- COVID-19患者的中性粒细胞功能和体内平衡受损：与疾病严重程度的相关性

**摘要**

背景：在COVID-19中，免疫应答失调是危重病的关键特征。中性粒细胞是早期先天性免疫的关键组分，如果调节不严，可导致不受控制的全身炎症。我们试图解释中性粒细胞表型、功能和稳态在COVID-19疾病严重程度和结局中的作用。

方法：通过使用流式细胞术，本纵向研究比较了90例COVID-19 ICU患者与22例因重症社区获得性肺炎(CAP)住院的SARS-CoV-2阴性患者和38例健康对照者的外周全血中性粒细胞。我们还评估了这些表型和功能指标与内皮损伤标志物以及疾病严重程度之间的相关性。

结果：在ICU入院时，COVID-19患者的循环中性粒细胞表现出未见于CAP患者的持续基础过度活化，与反映血小板和内皮活化的可溶性E-和P-选择素的循环水平较高相关。此外，COVID-19患者具有扩大的老化血管生成和逆迁移中性粒细胞亚群-均参与内皮功能障碍和血管炎症。同时，COVID-19患者对细菌甲酰肽反应的中性粒细胞氧化爆发水平显著降低。此外，COVID-19组死亡患者的老化血管生成中性粒细胞子集的扩张程度显著高于存活患者，氧化爆发反应受损程度也大于存活患者。

结论：这些数据表明，中性粒细胞耗竭可能参与重度COVID-19的发病机制，并确定血管生成中性粒细胞是参与致死性结局的潜在有害亚群。

## Prone positioning improves ventilation-perfusion matching assessed by electrical impedance tomography in patients with ARDS: a prospective physiological study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The physiological effects of prone ventilation in ARDS patients have been discussed for a long time but have not been fully elucidated. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has emerged as a tool for bedside monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, allowing the opportunity to obtain data. This study aimed to investigate the effect of prone positioning (PP) on ventilation-perfusion matching by contrast-enhanced EIT in patients with ARDS. DESIGN: Monocenter prospective physiologic study. SETTING: University medical ICU. PATIENTS: Ten mechanically ventilated ARDS patients who underwent PP. INTERVENTIONS: We performed EIT evaluation at the initiation of PP, 3 h after PP initiation and the end of PP during the first PP session. 

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The regional distribution of ventilation and perfusion was analyzed based on EIT images and compared to the clinical variables regarding respiratory and hemodynamic status. Prolonged prone ventilation improved oxygenation in the ARDS patients. Based on EIT measurements, the distribution of ventilation was homogenized and dorsal lung ventilation was significantly improved by PP administration, while the effect of PP on lung perfusion was relatively mild, with increased dorsal lung perfusion observed. The ventilation-perfusion matched region was found to increase and correlate with the increased PaO(2)/FiO(2) by PP, which was attributed mainly to reduced shunt in the lung. 

CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged prone ventilation increased dorsal ventilation and perfusion, which resulted in improved ventilation-perfusion matching and oxygenation.

##中文标题- 仰卧位改善ARDS患者电阻抗断层成像评估的通气-灌注匹配：一项前瞻性生理学研究

**摘要**

背景：关于ARDS患者俯卧位通气的生理效应讨论已久，但尚未完全阐明。电阻抗断层成像(EIT)已成为床旁监测肺通气和灌注的工具，允许获取数据。本研究旨在探讨俯卧位(PP)对ARDS患者通过对比增强EIT进行通气-灌注匹配的影响。设计：单中心前瞻性生理学研究。单位：大学医学中心。患者：10例接受PP的机械通气ARDS患者。干预：我们在PP开始时、PP开始后3h和PP结束时在第一次PP阶段进行了EIT评估。

测量和主要结果：基于EIT图像分析通气和灌注的区域分布，并与呼吸和血液动力学状态的临床变量进行比较。长期俯卧位通气改善了ARDS患者的氧合。根据EIT测量结果，PP给药后通气分布均匀，背侧肺通气显著改善，而PP对肺灌注的影响相对较轻，同时观察到背侧肺灌注增加。发现通气-灌注匹配区域增加，并与PP增加的PaO(2)/FiO(2)相关，这主要归因于肺内分流减少。

结论：长时间俯卧位通气增加背侧通气和灌注，导致通气-灌注匹配和氧合改善。

## Effect of abdominal weight training with and without cough machine assistance on lung function in the patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation: a randomized trial

**Abstract**

PURPOSE: The patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) have the risk of ineffective coughing and infection due to diaphragm weakness. This study aimed to explore the effect of abdominal weight training (AWT) intervention with/without cough machine (CM) assistance on lung function, respiratory muscle strength and cough ability in these patients. 

METHODS: Forty patients with PMV were randomly assigned to three groups: AWT group (n = 12), AWT + CM group (n = 14) and control group (n = 14). Change of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and peak cough flow (PCF) between 1 day before and 2 weeks after the intervention were compared among these three groups. 

RESULTS: MIP before and after intervention in AWT group (30.50 ± 11.73 vs. 36.00 ± 10.79; p < 0.05) and AWT + CM group (29.8 ± 12.14 vs. 36.14 ± 10.42; p < 0.05) compared with control group (28.43 ± 9.74 vs 26.71 ± 10.77; p > 0.05) was significantly improved. MEP before and after intervention in AWT group (30.58 ± 15.19 vs. 41.50 ± 18.33; p < 0.05) and AWT + CM group (27.29 ± 12.76 vs 42.43 ± 16.96; p < 0.05) compared with control group (28.86 ± 10.25 vs. 29.57 ± 14.21; p > 0.05) was significantly improved. PCF before and after intervention in AWT group in AWT group (105.83 ± 16.21 vs. 114.17 ± 15.20; p < 0.05) and AWT + CM group (108.57 ± 18.85 vs. 131.79 ± 38.96; p < 0.05) compared to control group (108.57 ± 19.96 vs. 109.86 ± 17.44; p > 0.05) showed significant improvements. AWT + CM group had significantly greater improvements than control group in MIP and peak cough flow than control group (13.71 ± 11.28 vs 19.64 ± 29.90, p < 0.05). 

CONCLUSION: AWT can significantly improve lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and cough ability in the PMV patients. AWT + CM can further improve their expiratory muscle strength and cough ability.

## Effect of erythromycin on mortality and the host response in critically ill patients with sepsis: a target trial emulation

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Immunomodulatory therapies that improve the outcome of sepsis are not available. We sought to determine whether treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis with low-dose erythromycin-a macrolide antibiotic with broad immunomodulatory effects-decreased mortality and ameliorated underlying disease pathophysiology. 

METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation, comparing patients with sepsis admitted to two intensive care units (ICU) in the Netherlands for at least 72 h, who were either exposed or not exposed during this period to treatment with low-dose erythromycin (up to 600 mg per day, administered as a prokinetic agent) but no other macrolides. We used two common propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) to deal with confounding by indication and subsequently used Cox regression models to estimate the treatment effect on the primary outcome of mortality rate up to day 90. Secondary clinical outcomes included change in SOFA, duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of ICU-acquired infections. We used linear mixed models to assess differences in 15 host response biomarkers reflective of key pathophysiological processes from admission to day 4. 

RESULTS: In total, 235 patients started low-dose erythromycin treatment, 470 patients served as controls. Treatment started at a median of 38 [IQR 25-52] hours after ICU admission for a median of 5 [IQR 3-8] total doses in the first course. Matching and weighting resulted in populations well balanced for proposed confounders. We found no differences between patients treated with low-dose erythromycin and control subjects in mortality rate up to day 90: matching HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.64-1.24), weighting HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.66-1.36). There were no differences in secondary clinical outcomes. The change in host response biomarker levels from admission to day 4 was similar between erythromycin-treated and control subjects. 

CONCLUSION: In this target trial emulation in critically ill patients with sepsis, we could not demonstrate an effect of treatment with low-dose erythromycin on mortality, secondary clinical outcomes or host response biomarkers.

##中文标题- 红霉素对败血症重症患者死亡率和宿主反应的影响：一项目标试验模拟

**摘要**

背景：尚无法获得改善败血症结局的免疫调节治疗。我们试图确定采用低剂量红霉素-大环内酯类抗生素治疗败血症重症患者是否具有广泛的免疫调节作用-降低死亡率并改善基础疾病的病理生理学。

方法：我们进行了一项目标试验模拟，比较在荷兰两个重症监护室(ICU)住院至少72h的脓毒症患者，这些患者在该期间暴露或未暴露于低剂量红霉素（每天最多600 mg，作为促动力药给药），而不是其他大环内酯类药物。我们使用了两种常见的倾向评分方法（匹配和逆概率治疗加权）来处理适应症混杂，随后使用Cox回归模型来估计治疗对死亡率主要结局的影响，直至第90天。次要临床结局包括SOFA的变化、机械通气持续时间和ICU获得性感染的发生率。我们使用线性混合模型评估15个宿主反应生物标志物的差异，反映从入院到第4天的关键病理生理过程。

结果：共有235例患者开始低剂量红霉素治疗，470例患者作为对照。在进入ICU后中位38小时[IQR 25-52小时]开始治疗，第一个疗程中总剂量的中位数为5[IQR 3-8]。匹配和加权导致拟定混杂因素的人群达到良好平衡。我们发现接受低剂量红霉素治疗的患者和对照组受试者直至第90天的死亡率无差异：匹配HR 0.89(95%CI 0.64-1.24)，加权HR 0.95(95%CI 0.66-1.36)。次要临床结局无差异。红霉素治疗组和对照组受试者从入院到第4天宿主反应生物标志物水平的变化相似。

结论：在这项在败血症重症患者中进行的目标试验模拟中，我们无法证明低剂量红霉素治疗对死亡率、次要临床结局或宿主反应生物标志物的影响。

## Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications

**Abstract**

Venous return is the flow of blood from the systemic venous network towards the right heart. At steady state, venous return equals cardiac output, as the venous and arterial systems operate in series. However, unlike the arterial one, the venous network is a capacitive system with a high compliance. It includes a part of unstressed blood, which is a reservoir that can be recruited via sympathetic endogenous or exogenous stimulation. Guyton's model describes the three determinants of venous return: the mean systemic filling pressure, the right atrial pressure and the resistance to venous return. Recently, new methods have been developed to explore such determinants at the bedside. In this narrative review, after a reminder about Guyton's model and current methods used to investigate it, we emphasize how Guyton's physiology helps understand the effects on cardiac output of common treatments used in critically ill patients.

##中文标题- 静脉回心血量和平均体循环充盈压：生理学和临床应用

**摘要**

静脉回流是指血液从体循环静脉网流向右心。稳态时，静脉回流等于心输出量，因为静脉和动脉系统是串联运行的。然而，与动脉网不同，静脉网是一种高依从性的电容式系统。它包括一部分无应激血液，这是一个储存库，可以通过内源性或外源性交感神经刺激招募。Guyton模型描述了静脉回流的三个决定因素：平均体循环充盈压、右心房压力和静脉回流阻力。最近，开发了新方法在床边探索这些决定因素。在本叙述性综述中，在提醒Guyton的模型和当前用于研究的方法后，我们强调了Guyton的生理学如何帮助理解重症患者常用治疗对心输出量的影响。

## A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Caregivers and family members of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors can face emotional problems following patient discharge from hospital. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-centre integrated health and social care intervention, on caregiver and family member outcomes. 

METHODS: This study evaluated the impact of the Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) programme across 9 sites in Scotland. InS:PIRE is an integrated health and social care intervention. We compared caregivers who attended this programme with a contemporary control group of ICU caregivers (usual care cohort), who did not attend. 

RESULTS: The primary outcome was anxiety measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 12 months post-hospital discharge. Secondary outcome measures included depression, carer strain and clinical insomnia. A total of 170 caregivers had data available at 12 months for inclusion in this study; 81 caregivers attended the InS:PIRE intervention and completed outcome measures at 12 months post-hospital discharge. In the usual care cohort of caregivers, 89 completed measures. The two cohorts had similar baseline demographics. After adjustment, those caregivers who attended InS:PIRE demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.89, p = 0.02), carer strain (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16-0.98 p = 0.04) and clinical insomnia (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.77 p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in symptoms of depression at 12 months. 

CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre evaluation has shown that caregivers who attended an integrated health and social care intervention reported improved emotional health and less symptoms of insomnia, 12 months after the delivery of the intervention.

##中文标题- 一项多中心评价，探索综合健康和社会护理干预对ICU存活者护理人员的影响

**摘要**

背景：护理人员和重症监护室(ICU)幸存者家属可能在患者出院后面临情绪问题。我们旨在评估多中心综合健康和社会护理干预对护理人员和家庭成员结局的影响。

方法：本研究评估了重症监护综合征：促进独立和重新就业(InS:PIRE)项目对苏格兰9个研究中心的影响。InS：PIRE是一种综合的健康和社会保健干预。我们比较了参与本项目的护理人员与未参与的当代ICU护理人员对照组（常规护理队列）。

结果：主要结局是在出院后12个月通过医院焦虑抑郁量表测量的焦虑。次要结局指标包括抑郁、护理者劳损和临床失眠。共有170名护理人员在12个月时提供了可纳入本研究的数据；81名护理人员参与了InS:PIRE干预，并完成了出院后12个月的结局测量。在护理人员的常规护理队列中，89例完成了测量。两个队列的基线人口统计学特征相似。调整后，参与InS:PIRE的护理人员表现出焦虑症状(OR:0.42,95%CI:0.20-0.89,p = 0.02)、照顾者压力(OR:0.39;95%CI:0.16-0.98 p = 0.04)和临床失眠(OR:0.40;95%CI:0.17-0.77 p < 0.001)的显著改善。12个月时抑郁症状无显著差异。

结论：该多中心评价表明，参与综合健康和社会护理干预的护理人员在干预实施后12个月报告情绪健康改善，失眠症状减少。

## Evolving outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used extensively for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports early in the pandemic suggested that mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO was comparable to non-COVID-19-related ARDS. However, subsequent reports suggested that mortality appeared to be increasing over time. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis, to characterise changes in mortality over time and elucidate risk factors for poor outcomes. 

METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis (CRD42021271202), searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases, from 1 December 2019 to 26 January 2022, for studies reporting on mortality among adults with COVID-19 receiving ECMO. We also captured hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and ECMO, as well as complications of ECMO. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and evaluated certainty of pooled estimates using GRADE methodology. 

RESULTS: Of 4522 citations, we included 52 studies comprising 18,211 patients in the meta-analysis. The pooled mortality rate among patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO was 48.8% (95% confidence interval 44.8-52.9%, high certainty). Mortality was higher among studies which enrolled patients later in the pandemic as opposed to earlier (1st half 2020: 41.2%, 2nd half 2020: 46.4%, 1st half 2021: 62.0%, 2nd half 2021: 46.5%, interaction p value = 0.0014). Predictors of increased mortality included age, the time of final patient enrolment from 1 January 2020, and the proportion of patients receiving corticosteroids, and reduced duration of ECMO run. 

CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate for patients receiving ECMO for COVID-19-related ARDS has increased as the pandemic has progressed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial; however, as outcomes for these patients evolve, the decision to initiate ECMO should include the best contextual estimate of mortality at the time of ECMO initiation.

##中文标题- COVID-19大流行前2年期间体外膜肺氧合的演变结局：一项系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)已广泛用于2019年冠状病毒病(COVID-19)相关的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)。大流行早期的报告表明，接受ECMO的COVID-19患者的死亡率与非COVID-19相关ARDS相当。然而，随后的报告表明死亡率似乎随时间而增加。因此，我们进行了一项更新的系统综述和荟萃分析，以表征死亡率随时间的变化，并阐明不良结局的风险因素。

方法：我们进行了一项荟萃分析(CRD42021271202)，检索了MEDLINE、Embase、Cochrane和Scopus数据库，时间范围为2019年12月2022年1月1月26日，查找报告接受ECMO的COVID-19成人患者死亡率的研究。我们还采集了住院和重症监护病房的住院时间、机械通气和ECMO的持续时间以及ECMO的并发症。我们进行了随机效应荟萃分析，使用Joanna Briggs Institute自评量表评估了纳入研究的偏倚风险，并使用GRADE方法评估了合并估计值的确定性。

结果：在4522篇引文中，我们纳入了52项研究，包括荟萃分析中的18,211例患者。需要ECMO的COVID-19患者的汇总死亡率为48.8%（95%置信区间44.8-52.9%，高度确定）。与早期研究相比，入组大流行较晚患者的研究死亡率更高（2020年上半年：41.2%，2020年下半年：46.4%，2021年上半年：62.0%，2021年下半年：46.5%，相互作用p值 = 0.0014）。死亡率升高的预测因素包括年龄、从2020年1月1日起最终患者入组的时间、接受皮质类固醇的患者比例和ECMO运行持续时间缩短。

结论：随着流感大流行的进展，因COVID-19相关ARDS而接受ECMO治疗的患者的死亡率增加。其原因可能是多因素的；但是，随着这些患者结局的变化，启动ECMO的决定应包括启动ECMO时死亡率的最佳背景估计。

## Long-term ketamine infusion-induced cholestatic liver injury in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: A higher-than-usual resistance to standard sedation regimens in COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has led to the frequent use of the second-line anaesthetic agent ketamine. Simultaneously, an increased incidence of cholangiopathies in mechanically ventilated patients receiving prolonged infusion of high-dose ketamine has been noted. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate a potential dose-response relationship between ketamine and bilirubin levels. 

METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort of patients suffering from COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 2020 and August 2021. A time-varying, multivariable adjusted, cumulative weighted exposure mixed-effects model was employed to analyse the exposure-effect relationship between ketamine infusion and total bilirubin levels. 

RESULTS: Two-hundred forty-three critically ill patients were included into the analysis. Ketamine was infused to 170 (70%) patients at a rate of 1.4 [0.9-2.0] mg/kg/h for 9 [4-18] days. The mixed-effects model revealed a positively correlated infusion duration-effect as well as dose-effect relationship between ketamine infusion and rising bilirubin levels (p < 0.0001). In comparison, long-term infusion of propofol and sufentanil, even at high doses, was not associated with increasing bilirubin levels (p = 0.421, p = 0.258). Patients having received ketamine infusion had a multivariable adjusted competing risk hazard of developing a cholestatic liver injury during their ICU stay of 3.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-7.8] (p = 0.01). 

CONCLUSIONS: A causally plausible, dose-effect relationship between long-term infusion of ketamine and rising total bilirubin levels, as well as an augmented, ketamine-associated, hazard of cholestatic liver injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients could be shown. High-dose ketamine should be refrained from whenever possible for the long-term analgosedation of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.

##中文标题- 长期氯胺酮输注引起的COVID-19相关性急性呼吸窘迫综合征中的胆汁淤积性肝损伤

**摘要**

背景：在患有急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)的COVID-19患者中，标准镇静方案的耐药性高于通常，导致经常使用二线麻醉剂氯胺酮。同时，在长期接受高剂量氯胺酮输注的机械通气患者中观察到胆管病的发生率增加。因此，本研究的目的是研究氯胺酮和胆红素水平之间潜在的剂量-反应关系。

方法：对2020年3月至2021年8月期间患COVID-19相关ARDS患者的前瞻性观察性队列进行事后分析。采用时变、多变量校正、累积加权暴露混合效应模型分析氯胺酮输注与总胆红素水平之间的暴露-效应关系。

结果：243例重症患者纳入分析。170名(70%)患者以1.4[0.9-2.0]mg/kg/h的速率接受了9[4-18]天的氯胺酮输注。混合效应模型显示氯胺酮输注与胆红素水平升高之间存在正相关输注持续时间效应和剂量效应关系(p < 0.0001)。相比之下，长期输注丙泊酚和舒芬太尼，即使在高剂量下，也与胆红素水平升高无关(p = 0.421，p = 0.258)。在ICU住院期间，接受氯胺酮输注的患者发生胆汁淤积性肝损伤的多变量校正竞争风险为3.2[95%置信区间，1.3-7.8](p = 0.01)。

结论：在COVID-19危重患者中，氯胺酮长期输注和总胆红素水平升高之间存在合理的剂量效应关系，氯胺酮相关的胆汁淤积性肝损伤风险增加。对于机械通气COVID-19患者的长期分析，应尽可能避免高剂量氯胺酮。

## Web-based application for predicting the potential target phenotype for recombinant human thrombomodulin therapy in patients with sepsis: analysis of three multicentre registries

**Abstract**

A recent randomised controlled trial failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of recombinant human thrombomodulin (rhTM) on sepsis. However, there is still controversy in the effects of rhTM for sepsis due to the heterogeneity of the study population. We previously identified patients with a distinct phenotype that could be a potential target of rhTM therapy (rhTM target phenotype). However, for application in the clinical setting, a simple tool for determining this target is necessary. Thus, using three multicentre sepsis registries, we aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model for predicting presence of the target phenotype that we previously identified for targeted rhTM therapy. The predictors were platelet count, PT-INR, fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. We also implemented the model as a web-based application. Two of the three registries were used for model development (n = 3694), and the remaining registry was used for validation (n = 1184). Approximately 8-9% of patients had the rhTM target phenotype in each cohort. In the validation, the C statistic of the developed model for predicting the rhTM target phenotype was 0.996 (95% CI 0.993-0.998), with a sensitivity of 0.991 and a specificity of 0.967. Among patients who were predicted to have the potential target phenotype (predicted target patients) in the validation cohort (n = 142), rhTM use was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted risk difference, - 31.3% [- 53.5 to - 9.1%]). The developed model was able to accurately predict the rhTM target phenotype. The model, which is available as a web-based application, could profoundly benefit clinicians and researchers investigating the heterogeneity in the treatment effects of rhTM and its mechanisms.

##中文标题- 基于网络的应用程序预测脓毒症患者接受重组人血栓调节蛋白治疗的潜在靶表型：3项多中心登记研究的分析

**摘要**

最近的一项随机对照试验未能证明重组人血栓调节蛋白(rhTM)对脓毒症的有益作用。然而，由于研究人群的异质性，rhTM治疗脓毒症的效果仍存在争议。我们先前确定了具有不同表型的患者可能是rhTM治疗的潜在靶标（rhTM靶标表型）。但是，在临床环境中应用时，需要一种确定该靶点的简单工具。因此，使用3个多中心败血症登记研究，我们旨在开发和验证一种机器学习模型，用于预测我们先前确定的靶向rhTM治疗的目标表型的存在。预测因子为血小板计数、PT-INR、纤维蛋白原、纤维蛋白原/纤维蛋白降解产物和D-二聚体。我们还将该模型作为网络应用程序实施。3项注册登记中的2项用于模型开发(n = 3694)，其余注册登记用于验证(n = 1184)。每个队列中约8-9%的患者具有rhTM靶表型。在验证中，建立的预测rhTM靶表型模型的C统计量为0.996(95%CI 0.993-0.998)，灵敏度为0.991，特异度为0.967。在验证队列(n = 142)中预计具有潜在目标表型的患者（预计目标患者）中，使用rhTM与住院死亡率降低相关（调整后的风险差异，-31.3%[-53.5至-9.1%]）。开发的模型能够准确预测rhTM靶表型。该模型可作为基于网络的应用，可使临床医生和研究人员极大获益，研究了rhTM治疗效果的异质性及其机制。

## TTCOV19: timing of tracheotomy in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients: a multicentre, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Critically ill COVID-19 patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Previous observational studies have suggested early tracheotomy to be advantageous. The aim of this parallel, multicentre, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the optimal timing of tracheotomy. 

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected patients within the Region Västra Götaland of Sweden who needed intubation and mechanical respiratory support were included and randomly assigned to early tracheotomy (≤ 7 days after intubation) or late tracheotomy (≥ 10 days after intubation). The primary objective was to compare the total number of mechanical ventilation days between the groups. 

RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients (mean age 65 years, 79% males) were included. Seventy-two patients were assigned to early tracheotomy, and 78 were assigned to late tracheotomy. One hundred two patients (68%) underwent tracheotomy of whom sixty-one underwent tracheotomy according to the protocol. The overall median number of days in mechanical ventilation was 18 (IQR 9; 28), but no significant difference was found between the two treatment regimens in the intention-to-treat analysis (between-group difference: - 1.5 days (95% CI - 5.7 to 2.8); p = 0.5). A significantly reduced number of mechanical ventilation days was found in the early tracheotomy group during the per-protocol analysis (between-group difference: - 8.0 days (95% CI - 13.8 to - 2.27); p = 0.0064). The overall correlation between the timing of tracheotomy and days of mechanical ventilation was significant (Spearman's correlation: 0.39, p < 0.0001). The total death rate during intensive care was 32.7%, but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding survival, complications or adverse events. 

CONCLUSIONS: The potential superiority of early tracheotomy when compared to late tracheotomy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was not confirmed by the present randomized controlled trial but is a strategy that should be considered in selected cases where the need for MV for more than 14 days cannot be ruled out.

##中文标题- TTCOV19：SARS-CoV-2感染患者的气管切开术时机：一项多中心、单盲、随机化、对照试验

**摘要**

背景：COVID-19重症患者可能发生急性呼吸窘迫综合征，需要呼吸支持，包括重症监护室的机械通气。既往的观察性研究提示早期气管切开是有利的。这项平行、多中心、单盲、随机对照试验的目的是评价气管切开的最佳时机。

方法：纳入瑞典Västra Götaland区内需要插管和机械呼吸支持的SARS-CoV-2-感染患者，并随机分配至早期气管切开术组（插管后≤7天）或晚期气管切开术组（插管后≥10天）。主要目的是比较两组之间的机械通气总天数。

结果：入选了150例患者（平均年龄65岁，79%为男性）。72例患者被分配接受早期气管切开术，78例患者被分配接受晚期气管切开术。102例患者(68%)接受了气管切开术，其中61例按照方案接受了气管切开术。机械通气的总中位天数为18天(IQR 9；28)，但在意向治疗分析中，两种治疗方案之间未见显著性差异（组间差异：-1.5天（95%CI-5.7至2.8）；p = 0.5）。在符合方案分析中，发现早期气管切开组的机械通气天数显著减少（组间差异：-8.0天（95%CI-13.8至-2.27）；p = 0.0064）。气管切开时间与机械通气天数之间的总体相关性显著（Spearman相关性：0.39，p < 0.0001）。重症监护期间的总死亡率为32.7%，但两组在生存期、并发症或不良事件方面未见显著性差异。

结论：在COVID-19重症患者中，早期气管切开术与晚期气管切开术相比的潜在优效性未得到当前随机对照试验的证实，但在无法排除超过14天的MV需求的选定病例中，这是一种应考虑的策略。

## Medical nutrition therapy and clinical outcomes in critically ill adults: a European multinational, prospective observational cohort study (EuroPN)

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Medical nutrition therapy may be associated with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. We wanted to assess nutrition practices in European intensive care units (ICU) and their importance for clinical outcomes. 

METHODS: Prospective multinational cohort study in patients staying in ICU ≥ 5 days with outcome recorded until day 90. Macronutrient intake from enteral and parenteral nutrition and non-nutritional sources during the first 15 days after ICU admission was compared with targets recommended by ESPEN guidelines. We modeled associations between three categories of daily calorie and protein intake (low: < 10 kcal/kg, < 0.8 g/kg; moderate: 10-20 kcal/kg, 0.8-1.2 g/kg, high: > 20 kcal/kg; > 1.2 g/kg) and the time-varying hazard rates of 90-day mortality or successful weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). 

RESULTS: A total of 1172 patients with median [Q1;Q3] APACHE II score of 18.5 [13.0;26.0] were included, and 24% died within 90 days. Median length of ICU stay was 10.0 [7.0;16.0] days, and 74% of patients could be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients reached on average 83% [59;107] and 65% [41;91] of ESPEN calorie and protein recommended targets, respectively. Whereas specific reasons for ICU admission (especially respiratory diseases requiring IMV) were associated with higher intakes (estimate 2.43 [95% CI: 1.60;3.25] for calorie intake, 0.14 [0.09;0.20] for protein intake), a lack of nutrition on the preceding day was associated with lower calorie and protein intakes (- 2.74 [- 3.28; - 2.21] and - 0.12 [- 0.15; - 0.09], respectively). Compared to a lower intake, a daily moderate intake was associated with higher probability of successful weaning (for calories: maximum HR 4.59 [95% CI: 1.5;14.09] on day 12; for protein: maximum HR 2.60 [1.09;6.23] on day 12), and with a lower hazard of death (for calories only: minimum HR 0.15, [0.05;0.39] on day 19). There was no evidence that a high calorie or protein intake was associated with further outcome improvements. 

CONCLUSIONS: Calorie intake was mainly provided according to the targets recommended by the active ESPEN guideline, but protein intake was lower. In patients staying in ICU ≥ 5 days, early moderate daily calorie and protein intakes were associated with improved clinical outcomes.

##中文标题- 危重成人患者的医学营养治疗和临床结局：一项欧洲多国、前瞻性观察性队列研究(EuroPN)

**摘要**

背景：医学营养治疗可能与延长重症监护室(ICU)住院时间的重症患者的临床结局相关。我们希望评估欧洲重症监护室(ICU)的营养实践及其对临床结局的重要性。

方法：在入住ICU≥5天的患者中进行的前瞻性多国家队列研究，记录结局至第90天。比较入住ICU后最初15天内从肠内和肠外营养和非营养来源摄入的大量营养素与ESPEN指南推荐的目标。我们对每日热量和蛋白质摄入量的3个类别（低：<10 kcal/kg，<0.8 g/kg；中：10-20 kcal/kg，0.8-1.2 g/kg，高：>20 kcal/kg；>1.2 g/kg）与90天死亡率或成功停用有创机械通气(IMV)的随时间变化的风险率之间的相关性进行了建模。

结果：共纳入1172例患者，中位[Q1；Q3]APACHE II评分为18.5[13.0；26.0]，24%在90天内死亡。中位ICU住院时间为10.0[7.0；16.0]天，74%的患者可从有创机械通气中脱机。患者分别平均达到83%[59；107]和65%[41；91]的ESPEN热量和蛋白质推荐目标。入住ICU的具体原因（尤其是需要IMV的呼吸系统疾病）与较高的摄入量相关（卡路里摄入量估计值为2.43[95%CI：1.60；3.25]，蛋白质摄入量估计值为0.14[0.09；0.20]），前一天缺乏营养与较低的卡路里和蛋白质摄入量相关（-2.74[-3.28；-分别为2.21]和-0.12[-0.15；-0.09]）。与较低的摄入量相比，每日中等摄入量与成功断奶的概率较高相关（卡路里：第12天最大HR 4.59[95%CI：1.5；14.09]；蛋白质：第12天最大HR 2.60[1.09；6.23]），死亡风险较低（仅卡路里：第19天最小HR 0.15[0.05；0.39]）。无证据表明高热量或蛋白质摄入与进一步结局改善相关。

结论：主要根据现行ESPEN指南推荐的目标提供热量摄入，但蛋白质摄入量较低。入住ICU≥5天的患者中，早期适度的每日热量和蛋白质摄入与临床结局改善相关。

## Early short course of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with COVID-19 ARDS: a propensity score analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The role of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate in COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS the impact of early use of NMBAs on 90-day mortality, through propensity score (PS) matching analysis. 

METHODS: We analyzed a convenience sample of patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, admitted to 244 intensive care units within the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium, from February 1, 2020, through October 31, 2021. Patients undergoing at least 2 days and up to 3 consecutive days of NMBAs (NMBA treatment), within 48 h from commencement of IMV were compared with subjects who did not receive NMBAs or only upon commencement of IMV (control). The primary objective in the PS-matched cohort was comparison between groups in 90-day in-hospital mortality, assessed through Cox proportional hazard modeling. Secondary objectives were comparisons in the numbers of ventilator-free days (VFD) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and 90 through competing risk regression. 

RESULTS: Data from 1953 patients were included. After propensity score matching, 210 cases from each group were well matched. In the PS-matched cohort, mean (± SD) age was 60.3 ± 13.2 years and 296 (70.5%) were male and the most common comorbidities were hypertension (56.9%), obesity (41.1%), and diabetes (30.0%). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death at 90 days in the NMBA treatment vs control group was 1.12 (95% CI 0.79, 1.59, p = 0.534). After adjustment for smoking habit and critical therapeutic covariates, the HR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.72, 1.61, p = 0.729). At 28 days, VFD were 16 (IQR 0-25) and 25 (IQR 7-26) in the NMBA treatment and control groups, respectively (sub-hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.67, 1.00, p = 0.055). At 90 days, VFD were 77 (IQR 0-87) and 87 (IQR 0-88) (sub-hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.69, 1.07; p = 0.177). 

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, short course of NMBA treatment, applied early, did not significantly improve 90-day mortality and VFD. In the absence of definitive data from clinical trials, NMBAs should be indicated cautiously in this setting.

##中文标题- COVID-19 ARDS患者早期短期使用神经肌肉阻滞剂：倾向评分分析

**摘要**

背景：神经肌肉阻滞剂(NMBA)在2019年冠状病毒病(COVID-19)急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)中的作用尚未完全阐明。因此，我们旨在通过倾向评分(PS)匹配分析，研究COVID-19中重度ARDS患者早期使用NMBA对90天死亡率的影响。

方法：我们分析了从2020年2月1日至2021年10月31日在COVID-19重症监护联盟内244家重症监护室的COVID-19和中重度ARDS患者的便利样本。在开始IMV后48h内接受至少2天和最多连续3天NMBA（NMBA治疗）的患者与未接受NMBA或仅开始IMV（对照）的受试者进行比较。PS匹配队列的主要目的是通过Cox比例风险模型评估比较组间90天住院死亡率。次要目的是通过竞争风险回归比较第1天和第28天之间以及第1天和第90天之间的无呼吸机天数(VFD)。

结果：纳入1953例患者的数据。倾向评分匹配后，每组210例匹配良好。在PS匹配队列中，平均(±SD)年龄为60.3±13.2岁，296名(70.5%)为男性，最常见的合并症为高血压(56.9%)、肥胖(41.1%)和糖尿病(30.0%)。NMBA治疗组与对照组第90天的未调整死亡风险比(HR)为1.12(95%CI 0.79，1.59，p = 0.534)。校正吸烟习惯和关键治疗协变量后，HR为1.07(95%CI 0.72，1.61，p = 0.729)。第28天，NMBA治疗组和对照组的VFD分别为16(IQR 0-25)和25(IQR 7-26)（次风险比0.82，95%CI 0.67，1.00，p = 0.055）。第90天，VFD为77(IQR 0-87)和87(IQR 0-88)（次风险比0.86(95%CI 0.69，1.07；p = 0.177)。

结论：在COVID-19和中重度ARDS患者中，早期应用NMBA短疗程治疗并未显著改善90天死亡率和VFD。由于缺乏临床试验的确切数据，在这种情况下应谨慎使用NMBA。

## Impact of prolonged requirement for insulin on 90-day mortality in critically ill patients without previous diabetic treatments: a post hoc analysis of the CONTROLING randomized control trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia can persist during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay and result in prolonged requirement for insulin (PRI). The impact of PRI on ICU patient outcomes is not known. We evaluated the relationship between PRI and Day 90 mortality in ICU patients without previous diabetic treatments. 

METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the CONTROLING trial, involving 12 French ICUs. Patients in the personalized glucose control arm with an ICU length of stay ≥ 5 days and who had never previously received diabetic treatments (oral drugs or insulin) were included. Personalized blood glucose targets were estimated on their preadmission usual glycemia as estimated by their glycated A1c hemoglobin (HbA1C). PRI was defined by insulin requirement. The relationship between PRI on Day 5 and 90-day mortality was assessed by Cox survival models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Glycemic control was defined as at least one blood glucose value below the blood glucose target value on Day 5. 

RESULTS: A total of 476 patients were included, of whom 62.4% were male, with a median age of 66 (54-76) years. Median values for SAPS II and HbA1C were 50 (37.5-64) and 5.7 (5.4-6.1)%, respectively. PRI was observed in 364/476 (72.5%) patients on Day 5. 90-day mortality was 23.1% in the whole cohort, 25.3% in the PRI group and 16.1% in the non-PRI group (p < 0.01). IPTW analysis showed that PRI on Day 5 was not associated with Day 90 mortality ((IPTW)HR = 1.22; CI 95% 0.84-1.75; p = 0.29), whereas PRI without glycemic control was associated with an increased risk of death at Day 90 ((IPTW)HR = 3.34; CI 95% 1.26-8.83; p < 0.01). 

CONCLUSION: In ICU patients without previous diabetic treatments, only PRI without glycemic control on Day 5 was associated with an increased risk of death. Additional studies are required to determine the factors contributing to these results.

##中文标题- 在既往未接受过糖尿病治疗的重症患者中，长期胰岛素需求对90天死亡率的影响：一项随机对照试验的事后分析

**摘要**

背景：应激性高血糖可能在重症监护室(ICU)停留期间持续存在，并导致对胰岛素(PRI)的需求延长。PRI对ICU患者结局的影响未知。我们评估了PRI与未接受过糖尿病治疗的ICU患者第90天死亡率之间的关系。

方法：这是一项对照试验的事后分析，涉及12个法国ICU。个体化血糖控制组中，ICU住院时间≥5天的患者和既往从未接受过糖尿病治疗（口服药物或胰岛素）的患者均纳入研究。根据他们入院前的糖化血红蛋白A1c(HbA1 C)估计的通常血糖来估计个性化血糖目标。PRI由胰岛素需求定义。通过Cox生存模型和逆概率治疗加权(IPTW)评估第5天PRI与90天死亡率之间的关系。血糖控制定义为第5天至少有一个血糖值低于血糖目标值。

结果：共纳入476例患者，其中62.4%为男性，中位年龄66(54-76)岁。SAPS II和HbA1 C的中位值分别为50(37.5-64)和5.7(5.4-6.1)%。第5天在364/476例(72.5%)患者中观察到PRI。整个队列中90天死亡率为23.1%，PRI组为25.3%，非PRI组为16.1%(p < 0.01)。IPTW分析表明，第5天的PRI与第90天的死亡率无关((IPTW)HR = 1.22；CI 95%0.84-1.75；p = 0.29)，而未控制血糖的PRI与第90天的死亡风险增加相关((IPTW)HR = 3.34；CI 95%1.26-8.83；p < 0.01)。

结论：在既往未接受过糖尿病治疗的ICU患者中，仅第5天未控制血糖的PRI与死亡风险增加相关。还需要其他研究来确定导致这些结果的因素。

## Prevalence and prognostic value of preexisting sarcopenia in patients with mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is defined as age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and/or function in the context of aging. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is one of the most frequently used critical care technologies in critically ill patients. The prevalence of preexisting sarcopenia and the clinical impact of its prognostic value on patients with MV are unclear. This review sought to identify the prevalence and prognostic value of preexisting sarcopenia on MV patient health outcomes. 

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library and were searched for all articles published as of December 2021. The prevalence of sarcopenia was determined using the authors' definitions from the original studies. Comparisons were made between patients who did and did not have sarcopenia for prognostic outcomes, including mortality, the number of days of MV, the length of intensive care unit stay, and the length of hospital stay. Odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for pooled analyses of the relationships between sarcopenia and prognostic outcomes. 

RESULTS: The initial search identified 1333 studies, 17 of which met the eligibility criteria for the quantitative analysis, including 3582 patients. The pooled prevalence was 43.0% (95% CI 34.0-51.0%; I(2) = 96.7%). The pooled analyses showed that sarcopenia was related to increased mortality (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.70, 2.67; I(2) = 45.0%), longer duration of MV (MD = 1.22; 95% CI 0.39, 2.05; I(2) = 97.0%), longer days of ICU stay (MD = 1.31; 95% CI 0.43, 2.19; I(2) = 97.0%), and hospital stay (MD 2.73; 95% CI 0.58, 4.88; I(2) = 98.0%) in patients with MV. 

CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sarcopenia is relatively high in patients with MV, and it will have a negative impact on the prognosis of patients. However, further, large-scale, high-quality prospective cohort studies are required.

##中文标题- 机械通气患者中既存肌肉减少症的患病率和预后价值：系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：肌肉减少症定义为衰老背景下肌肉质量、强度和/或功能的年龄相关损失。机械通气(MV)是重症患者最常用的重症监护技术之一。既存肌肉减少症的患病率及其对MV患者预后价值的临床影响尚不清楚。该审查旨在确定既存肌肉减少症的患病率和对MV患者健康结局的预后价值。

方法：通过检索MEDLINE、Embase和Cochrane library查找相关研究，检索截至2021年12月发表的所有文章。采用来自原始研究的作者定义确定肌肉减少症的患病率。比较有和无肌肉减少症的患者的预后结局，包括死亡率、MV天数、重症监护室停留时间和住院时间。采用比值比(OR)和加权平均差异及95%置信区间(CI)对肌肉减少症和预后结局之间的关系进行了汇总分析。

结果：初步检索确定了1333项研究，其中17项符合定量分析的合格标准，包括3582例患者。汇总的患病率为43.0%(95%CI 34.0-51.0%；I(2)= 96.7%)。汇总分析显示，肌肉减少症与死亡率增加(OR 2.13；95%CI 1.70，2.67；I(2)= 45.0%)、MV持续时间延长(MD = 1.22；95%CI 0.39，2.05；I(2)= 97.0%)、ICU停留时间延长(MD = 1.31；95%CI 0.43，2.19；I(2)= 97.0%)和住院时间延长（MD 2.73；95%CI 0.58，4.88；I(2)= 98.0%）。

结论：MV患者中肌肉减少症的患病率相对较高，它将对患者的预后产生负面影响。但是，还需要进一步的大规模、高质量的前瞻性队列研究。

## Termination-of-resuscitation rule in the emergency department for patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide, population-based observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In Japan, emergency medical service (EMS) providers are prohibited from field termination-of-resuscitation (TOR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. In 2013, we developed a TOR rule for emergency department physicians (Goto's TOR rule) immediately after hospital arrival. However, this rule is subject to flaws, and there is a need for revision owing to its relatively low specificity for predicting mortality compared with other TOR rules in the emergency department. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a modified Goto's TOR rule by considering prehospital EMS cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration. 

METHODS: We analysed the records of 465,657 adult patients with OHCA from the All-Japan Utstein registry from 2016 to 2019 and divided them into two groups: development (n = 231,363) and validation (n = 234,294). The primary outcome measures were specificity, false-positive rate (FPR), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised TOR rule in the emergency department for predicting 1-month mortality. 

RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis for the development group in predicting 1-month mortality revealed that a modified Goto's TOR rule could be defined if patients with OHCA met the following four criteria: (1) initial asystole, (2) unwitnessed arrest by any laypersons, (3) EMS-CPR duration > 20 min, and (4) no prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The specificity, FPR, and PPV of the rule for predicting 1-month mortality were 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.0-99.4%), 0.8% (0.6-1.0%), and 99.8% (99.8-99.9%), respectively. The proportion of patients who fulfilled the rule and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was 27.5% (95% CI 27.3-27.7%) and 0.904 (0.902-0.905), respectively. In the validation group, the specificity, FPR, PPV, proportion of patients who met the rule, and AUC were 99.1% (95% CI 98.9-99.2%), 0.9% (0.8-1.1%), 99.8% (99.8-99.8%), 27.8% (27.6-28.0%), and 0.889 (0.887-0.891), respectively. 

CONCLUSION: The modified Goto's TOR rule (which includes the following four criteria: initial asystole, unwitnessed arrest, EMS-CPR duration > 20 min, and no prehospital ROSC) with a > 99% predictor of 1-month mortality is a reliable tool for physicians treating refractory OHCAs immediately after hospital arrival.

##中文标题- 难治性院外心脏骤停患者在急诊科的复苏终止规则：一项基于全国人群的观察性研究

**摘要**

背景：在日本，紧急医疗服务(EMS)提供者禁止在院外心脏骤停(OHCA)患者中进行现场复苏终止(TOR)。2013年，我们在医院到达后立即为急诊科医生制定了TOR规则（Goto的TOR规则）。但是，该规则存在缺陷，与急诊科的其他TOR规则相比，其预测死亡率的特异性相对较低，因此需要进行修订。因此，本研究旨在通过考虑院前EMS心肺复苏(CPR)持续时间来开发和验证改良Goto的TOR规则。

方法：我们分析了2016年至2019年来自全日本Utstein登记研究的465,657例成人OHCA患者的记录，并将其分为两组：开发(n = 231,363)和验证(n = 234,294)。主要结局指标为急诊科预测1个月死亡率的修订TOR规则的特异性、假阳性率(FPR)和阳性预测值(PPV)。

结果：对开发组预测1个月死亡率的递归分区分析显示，如果OHCA患者符合以下四个标准，可以定义改良的Goto TOR规则：(1)初始心搏停止，(2)任何非专业人员无目击者的心脏骤停，(3)EMS-CPR持续时间 > 20 min，(4)院前无自主循环恢复(ROSC)。预测1个月死亡率的规则的特异性、FPR和PPV分别为99.2%（95%置信区间[CI]，99.0-99.4%）、0.8%(0.6-1.0%)和99.8%(99.8-99.9%)。符合规则的患者比例和受试者工作曲线下面积(AUC)分别为27.5%(95%CI 27.3-27.7%)和0.904(0.902-0.905)。验证组特异性、FPR、PPV、符合规则的患者比例、AUC分别为99.1%(95%CI 98.9-99.2%)、0.9%(0.8-1.1%)、99.8%(99.8-99.8%)、27.8%(27.6-28.0%)、0.889(0.887-0.891)。

结论：改良Goto TOR规则（包括以下四个标准：初始心搏停止、无目击者的心搏停止、EMS-CPR持续时间 > 20 min和无院前ROSC）预测1个月死亡率 > 99%是医生在医院到达后立即治疗难治性OHCA的可靠工具。

## Hospital-onset sepsis and community-onset sepsis in critical care units in Japan: a retrospective cohort study based on a Japanese administrative claims database

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Hospital- and community-onset sepsis are significant sepsis subgroups. Japanese data comparing these subgroups are limited. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of hospital- and community-onset sepsis in critical care units in Japan. 

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Diagnosis and Procedure Combination database. Adult patients admitted to critical care units with sepsis from April 2010 to March 2020 were included. Sepsis cases were identified based on ICD-10 codes for infectious diseases, procedure codes for blood culture tests, and medication codes for antimicrobials. Patients' characteristics, in-hospital mortality, and resource utilization were assessed. The in-hospital mortality between groups was compared using the Poisson regression generalized linear mixed-effect model. 

RESULTS: Of 516,124 patients, 52,183 (10.1%) had hospital-onset sepsis and 463,940 (89.9%) had community-onset sepsis. Hospital-onset sepsis was characterized by younger age, infrequent emergency hospitalization, frequent surgery under general anesthesia, and frequent organ support upon critical care unit admission compared to community-onset sepsis. In-hospital mortality was higher for hospital-onset than for community-onset sepsis (35.5% versus 19.2%; unadjusted mean difference, 16.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.9-16.7]; adjusted mean difference, 15.6% [95% CI 14.9-16.2]). Mean hospital length of stay was longer for hospital-onset than for community-onset sepsis (47 days versus 30 days; unadjusted mean difference, 17 days [95% CI 16-17]; adjusted mean difference, 13 days [95% CI 12-14]). 

CONCLUSION: Patients with hospital-onset sepsis admitted to critical care units in Japan had a poorer prognosis and more resource utilization including organ support rate, number of days with critical care unit surcharge codes, and hospital length of stay than those with community-onset sepsis.

##中文标题- 日本重症监护室中的医院内发生的败血症和社区内发生的败血症：一项基于日本管理索赔数据库的回顾性队列研究

**摘要**

背景：住院和社区发作败血症是显著的败血症亚组。比较这些亚组的日本数据有限。本研究旨在描述日本重症监护室中医院和社区发作性败血症的流行病学。

方法：我们使用日本诊断和手术组合数据库进行了一项回顾性队列研究。纳入2010年4月至2020年3月因败血症入住重症监护室的成人患者。根据传染病的ICD-10代码、血培养检查的程序代码和抗菌药的药物代码确定败血症病例。评估了患者特征、住院死亡率和资源利用。使用泊松回归广义线性混合效应模型比较两组之间的住院死亡率。

结果：在516,124例患者中，52,183例(10.1%)为医院发作性败血症，463,940例(89.9%)为社区发作性败血症。与社区发作的败血症相比，医院发作的败血症的特征为年龄较小、不常急诊住院、常在全身麻醉下进行手术和在重症监护室住院时频繁进行器官支持。医院发病的院内死亡率高于社区发病的败血症（35.5%vs 19.2%；未校正的平均差异，16.3%[95%置信区间(CI)15.9-16.7]；校正的平均差异，15.6%[95%CI 14.9-16.2]）。医院发病的平均住院时间长于社区发病的败血症（47天vs 30天；未校正的平均差异，17天[95%CI 16-17]；校正的平均差异，13天[95%CI 12-14]）。

结论：与社区发作败血症患者相比，日本医院发作败血症患者的预后较差，资源利用更多，包括器官支持率、有重症监护室附加费用代码的天数和住院时间。

## Clinical and biochemical endpoints and predictors of response to plasma exchange in septic shock: results from a randomized controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Recently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated rapid but individually variable hemodynamic improvement with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in patients with septic shock. Prediction of clinical efficacy in specific sepsis treatments is fundamental for individualized sepsis therapy. 

METHODS: In the original RCT, patients with septic shock of < 24 h duration and norepinephrine (NE) requirement ≥ 0.4 μg/kg/min received standard of care (SOC) or SOC + one single TPE. Here, we report all clinical and biological endpoints of this study. Multivariate mixed-effects modeling of NE reduction was performed to investigate characteristics that could be associated with clinical response to TPE. 

RESULTS: A continuous effect of TPE on the reduction in NE doses over the initial 24 h was observed (SOC group: estimated NE dose reduction of 0.005 µg/kg/min per hour; TPE group: 0.018 µg/kg/min per hour, p = 0.004). Similarly, under TPE, serum lactate levels, continuously decreased over the initial 24 h in the TPE group, whereas lactate levels increased under SOC (p = 0.001). A reduction in biomarkers and disease mediators (such as PCT (p = 0.037), vWF:Ag (p < 0.001), Angpt-2 (p = 0.009), sTie-2 (p = 0.005)) along with a repletion of exhausted protective factors (such as AT-III (p = 0.026), Protein C (p = 0.012), ADAMTS-13 (p = 0.008)) could be observed in the TPE but not in the SOC group. In a multivariate mixed effects model, increasing baseline lactate levels led to greater NE dose reduction effects with TPE as opposed to SOC (p = 0.004). 

CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive TPE is associated with the removal of injurious mediators and repletion of consumed protective factors altogether leading to preserved hemodynamic stabilization in refractory septic shock. We identified that baseline lactate concentration as a potential response predictor might guide future designing of large RCTs that will further evaluate TPE with regard to hard endpoints.

##中文标题- 脓毒性休克中血浆置换的临床和生化终点和应答预测因素：随机对照试验的结果

**摘要**

背景：最近，一项随机对照试验(RCT)证实，治疗性血浆置换(TPE)可快速但个体可变的改善感染性休克患者的血液动力学。特定败血症治疗的临床疗效预测是个体化败血症治疗的基础。

方法：在原始RCT中，持续时间 < 24h且去甲肾上腺素(NE)需求≥0.4 μg/kg/min的脓毒性休克患者接受了标准治疗(SOC)或SOC + 单一TPE。在此，我们报告了本研究的所有临床和生物学终点。进行NE减少的多变量混合效应建模，研究可能与TPE临床反应相关的特征。

结果：观察到TPE在最初24h内对NE剂量减少的持续作用（SOC组：估计NE剂量减少0.005 μg/kg/min/小时；TPE组：0.018 μg/kg/min/小时，p = 0.004）。同样，在TPE条件下，TPE组的血清乳酸盐水平在最初24h内持续下降，而在SOC条件下，乳酸盐水平升高(p = 0.001)。在TPE组可观察到生物标志物和疾病介质（如PCT(p = 0.037)、vWF:Ag(p < 0.001)、Angpt-2(p = 0.009)、sTie-2(p = 0.005)减少，同时耗尽的保护因子（如AT-III(p = 0.026)、Protein C(p = 0.012)、ADAMTS-13(p = 0.008)）再次耗尽，但在SOC组未观察到。在多变量混合效应模型中，与SOC相反，基线乳酸盐水平升高导致采用TPE时NE剂量降低效应更大(p = 0.004)。

结论：在难治性脓毒性休克中，辅助TPE与损伤介质的去除和消耗的保护因子的补充相关，共同导致维持血液动力学稳定。我们发现，基线乳酸盐浓度可作为潜在的反应预测因子，可指导将来设计大型RCT，进一步评价TPE的硬终点。

## Hemoperfusion: technical aspects and state of the art

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Blood purification through the removal of plasma solutes by adsorption to beads of charcoal or resins contained in a cartridge (hemoperfusion) has a long and imperfect history. Developments in production and coating technology, however, have recently increased the biocompatibility of sorbents and have spurred renewed interest in hemoperfusion. 

METHODS: We performed a narrative assessment of the literature with focus on the technology, characteristics, and principles of hemoperfusion. We assessed publications in ex vivo, animal, and human studies. We synthesized such literature in a technical and state-of-the-art summary. 

RESULTS: Early hemoperfusion studies were hampered by bioincompatibility. Recent technology, however, has improved its safety. Hemoperfusion has been used with positive effects in chronic dialysis and chronic liver disease. It has also demonstrated extraction of a variety of toxins and drugs during episodes of overdose. Trials with endotoxin binding polymyxin B have shown mixed results in septic shock and are under active investigation. The role of non-selective hemoperfusion in sepsis or inflammation remains. Although new technologies have made sorbents more biocompatible, the research agenda in the field remains vast. 

CONCLUSION: New sorbents markedly differ from those used in the past because of greater biocompatibility and safety. Initial studies of novel sorbent-based hemoperfusion show some promise in specific chronic conditions and some acute states. Systematic studies of novel sorbent-based hemoperfusion are now both necessary and justified.

结果：生物不相容性妨碍了早期血液灌注研究。然而，最新技术提高了其安全性。血液灌注已被用于慢性透析和慢性肝病，并获得了积极效果。研究还证实在药物过量发作时可提取多种毒素和药物。内毒素结合多粘菌素B的试验显示，脓毒性休克的结果不一致，正在积极研究中。非选择性血液灌注在败血症或炎症中的作用仍然存在。虽然新技术使吸附剂更具有生物相容性，但该领域的研究议程仍很广泛。

结论：由于生物相容性和安全性更高，新吸附剂与过去使用的吸附剂明显不同。新型吸附剂血液灌注的初步研究显示，其有望用于特定慢性疾病和一些急性疾病。目前，对新型的基于吸附剂的血液灌流进行系统性研究是必要的和合理的。

## Impact of critical illness and withholding of early parenteral nutrition in the pediatric intensive care unit on long-term physical performance of children: a 4-year follow-up of the PEPaNIC randomized controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Many critically ill children face long-term developmental impairments. The PEPaNIC trial attributed part of the problems at the level of neurocognitive and emotional/behavioral development to early use of parenteral nutrition (early-PN) in the PICU, as compared with withholding it for 1 week (late-PN). Insight in long-term daily life physical functional capacity after critical illness is limited. Also, whether timing of initiating PN affects long-term physical function of these children remained unknown. 

METHODS: This preplanned follow-up study of the multicenter PEPaNIC randomized controlled trial subjected 521 former critically ill children (253 early-PN, 268 late-PN) to quantitative physical function tests 4 years after PICU admission in Leuven or Rotterdam, in comparison with 346 age- and sex-matched healthy children. Tests included handgrip strength measurement, timed up-and-go test, 6-min walk test, and evaluation of everyday overall physical activity with an accelerometer. We compared these functional measures for the former critically ill and healthy children and for former critically ill children randomized to late-PN versus early-PN, with multivariable linear or logistic regression analyses adjusting for risk factors. 

RESULTS: As compared with healthy children, former critically ill children showed less handgrip strength (p < 0.0001), completed the timed up-and-go test more slowly (p < 0.0001), walked a shorter distance in 6 min (p < 0.0001) during which they experienced a larger drop in peripheral oxygen saturation (p ≤ 0.026), showed a lower energy expenditure (p ≤ 0.024), performed more light and less moderate physical activity (p ≤ 0.047), and walked fewer steps per day (p = 0.0074). Late-PN as compared with early-PN did not significantly affect these outcomes. 

CONCLUSIONS: Four years after PICU admission, former critically ill children showed worse physical performance as compared with healthy children, without impact of timing of supplemental PN in the PICU. This study provides further support for de-implementing the early use of PN in the PICU.

##中文标题- 儿科重症监护室中危重疾病和暂停早期肠外营养对儿童长期体能的影响：PEPaNIC随机对照试验的4年随访

**摘要**

背景：许多危重患儿面临长期的发育障碍。PEPaNIC试验将神经认知和情绪/行为发育水平的部分问题归因于PICU早期使用肠外营养（早期PN），而相比之下，暂停1周（晚期PN）。危重病后对长期日常生活身体机能的洞察力有限。此外，尚不清楚开始PN的时间是否影响这些儿童的长期身体功能。

方法：该多中心PEPaNIC随机对照试验的预先计划随访研究比较了346例年龄和性别匹配的健康儿童，其中521例前危重儿童（253例早期PN，268例晚期PN）在Leuven或鹿特丹入住PICU 4年后接受定量身体功能检查。试验包括握力测量、起立-行走计时试验、6 min步行试验和用加速计评估每日总体体力活动。我们比较了既往危重和健康儿童以及随机接受晚期PN与早期PN的既往危重儿童的这些功能指标，采用多变量线性或logistic回归分析校正了风险因素。

结果：与健康儿童相比，既往重症儿童的握力较小(p < 0.0001)，完成起立-行走时间试验较慢(p < 0.0001)，在6 min内步行距离较短(p < 0.0001)，期间其外周血氧饱和度下降幅度较大(p≤0.026)，显示出较低的能量消耗(p≤0.024)，进行更多轻度和更少中度体力活动(p≤0.047)，每天步行较少的步骤(p = 0.0074)。与早期PN相比，晚期PN未显著影响这些结局。

结论：PICU入院后4年，与健康儿童相比，既往重症儿童的体能状态较差，不影响PICU补充PN的时机。本研究进一步支持在PICU中去实施早期使用PN。

## Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective large cohort multicenter study in Japan

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been increasing rapidly worldwide. However, guidelines or clinical studies do not provide sufficient data on ECPR practice. The aim of this study was to provide real-world data on ECPR for patients with OHCA, including details of complications. 

METHODS: We did a retrospective database analysis of observational multicenter cohort study in Japan. Adult patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology who received ECPR between 2013 and 2018 were included. The primary outcome was favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge, defined as a cerebral performance category of 1 or 2. 

RESULTS: A total of 1644 patients with OHCA were included in this study. The patient age was 18-93 years (median: 60 years). Shockable rhythm in the initial cardiac rhythm at the scene was 69.4%. The median estimated low flow time was 55 min (interquartile range: 45-66 min). Favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was observed in 14.1% of patients, and the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 27.2%. The proportions of favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge in terms of shockable rhythm, pulseless electrical activity, and asystole were 16.7%, 9.2%, and 3.9%, respectively. Complications were observed during ECPR in 32.7% of patients, and the most common complication was bleeding, with the rates of cannulation site bleeding and other types of hemorrhage at 16.4% and 8.5%, respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, data on the ECPR of 1644 patients with OHCA show that the proportion of favorable neurological outcomes at hospital discharge was 14.1%, survival rate at hospital discharge was 27.2%, and complications were observed during ECPR in 32.7%.

## Diagnostic concordance between BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel and culture in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care units: the experience of the third wave in eight hospitals in Colombia

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The detection of coinfections is important to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Molecular diagnostic testing identifies pathogens at a greater rate than conventional microbiology. We assessed both bacterial coinfections identified via culture or the BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel (FA-PNEU) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the ICU and the concordance between these techniques. 

METHODS: This was a prospective study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were hospitalized for no more than 48 h and on mechanical ventilation for no longer than 24 h in 8 ICUs in Medellín, Colombia. We studied mini-bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal aspirate samples processed via conventional culture and the FA-PNEU. Coinfection was defined as the identification of a respiratory pathogen using the FA-PNEU or cultures. Serum samples of leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were taken on the first day of intubation. We analyzed the empirical antibiotics and the changes in antibiotic management according to the results of the FA-PNEUM and cultures. 

RESULTS: Of 110 patients whose samples underwent both methods, FA-PNEU- and culture-positive samples comprised 24.54% versus 17.27%, respectively. Eighteen samples were positive in both techniques, 82 were negative, 1 was culture-positive with a negative FA-PNEU result, and 9 were FA-PNEU-positive with negative culture. The two bacteria most frequently detected by the FA-PNEU were Staphylococcus aureus (37.5%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (20%), and those detected by culture were Staphylococcus aureus (34.78%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.08%). The overall concordance was 90.1%, and when stratified by microorganism, it was between 92.7 and 100%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was between 50 and 100% and were lower for Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. The negative predictive value (NPV) was high (between 99.1 and 100%); MecA/C/MREJ had a specificity of 94.55% and an NPV of 100%. The inflammatory response tests showed no significant differences between patients whose samples were positive and negative for both techniques. Sixty-one patients (55.45%) received at least one dose of empirical antibiotics. 

CONCLUSIONS: The overall concordance was 90.1%, and it was between 92.7% and 100% when stratified by microorganisms. The positive predictive value was between 50 and 100%, with a very high NPV.

##中文标题- BioFire®FilmArray®肺炎检测试剂盒与培养对入住重症监护室的COVID-19肺炎患者的诊断一致性：哥伦比亚8家医院第三次波的经验

**摘要**

背景：共感染的检测对启动适当的抗菌治疗很重要。分子诊断检测比常规微生物学识别病原体的速度更快。我们评估了通过培养或BioFire®FilmArray®肺炎试剂盒(FA-PNEU)鉴定的ICU中SARS-CoV-2感染患者的细菌双重感染以及这些技术之间的一致性。

方法：这是一项前瞻性研究，在哥伦比亚Medellín的8个ICU中，SARS-CoV-2患者住院不超过48h，机械通气不超过24h。我们研究了通过常规培养和FA-PNEU处理的微量支气管肺泡灌洗或气管内抽吸样本。共感染定义为使用FA-PNEU或培养物鉴定出呼吸道病原体。在插管的第一天采集了白细胞、C反应蛋白和降钙素原的血清样本。我们根据FA-PNEUM和培养结果分析了经验性抗生素和抗生素管理的变化。

结果：110例同时使用两种方法的患者中，FA-PNEU-和培养阳性样本分别占24.54%和17.27%。两种技术均为阳性的18份样本，82份为阴性，1份培养阳性伴阴性FA-PNEU结果，9份FA-PNEU阳性伴阴性培养。FA-PNEU最常检出的两种细菌是金黄色葡萄球菌(37.5%)和无乳链球菌(20%)，培养检出的细菌是金黄色葡萄球菌(34.78%)和肺炎克雷伯菌(26.08%)。总体一致性为90.1%，按微生物分层时，其在92.7和100%之间。阳性预测值(PPV)在50-100%之间，阴沟肠杆菌和金黄色葡萄球菌更低。阴性预测值(NPV)较高（在99.1和100%之间）；MecA/C/MREJ的特异性为94.55%，NPV为100%。炎症反应试验显示，两种技术阳性和阴性样本患者之间无显著差异。61例患者(55.45%)至少接受1剂经验性抗生素治疗。

结论：总体一致性为90.1%，按微生物分层时在92.7%和100%之间。阳性预测值介于50-100%之间，NPV非常高。

## Lung response to prone positioning in mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Prone positioning improves survival in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This benefit is probably mediated by a decrease in alveolar collapse and hyperinflation and a more homogeneous distribution of lung aeration, with fewer harms from mechanical ventilation. In this preliminary physiological study we aimed to verify whether prone positioning causes analogue changes in lung aeration in COVID-19. A positive result would support prone positioning even in this other population. 

METHODS: Fifteen mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 underwent a lung computed tomography in the supine and prone position with a constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) within three days of endotracheal intubation. Using quantitative analysis, we measured the volume of the non-aerated, poorly-aerated, well-aerated, and over-aerated compartments and the gas-to-tissue ratio of the ten vertical levels of the lung. In addition, we expressed the heterogeneity of lung aeration with the standardized median absolute deviation of the ten vertical gas-to-tissue ratios, with lower values indicating less heterogeneity. 

RESULTS: By the time of the study, PEEP was 12 (10-14) cmH(2)O and the PaO(2):FiO(2) 107 (84-173) mmHg in the supine position. With prone positioning, the volume of the non-aerated compartment decreased by 82 (26-147) ml, of the poorly-aerated compartment increased by 82 (53-174) ml, of the normally-aerated compartment did not significantly change, and of the over-aerated compartment decreased by 28 (11-186) ml. In eight (53%) patients, the volume of the over-aerated compartment decreased more than the volume of the non-aerated compartment. The gas-to-tissue ratio of the ten vertical levels of the lung decreased by 0.34 (0.25-0.49) ml/g per level in the supine position and by 0.03 (- 0.11 to 0.14) ml/g in the prone position (p < 0.001). The standardized median absolute deviation of the gas-to-tissue ratios of those ten levels decreased in all patients, from 0.55 (0.50-0.71) to 0.20 (0.14-0.27) (p < 0.001). 

CONCLUSIONS: In fifteen patients with COVID-19, prone positioning decreased alveolar collapse, hyperinflation, and homogenized lung aeration. A similar response has been observed in other ARDS, where prone positioning improves outcome. Therefore, our data provide a pathophysiological rationale to support prone positioning even in COVID-19.

##中文标题- COVID-19机械通气患者俯卧位的肺反应

**摘要**

背景：俯卧位改善与新型冠状病毒病(COVID-19)无关的中重度急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)的生存率。这种获益很可能是由肺泡萎缩和过度充气的减少以及肺通气更均匀的分布介导，机械通气的危害更少。在这项初步的生理学研究中，我们旨在验证俯卧位是否会导致COVID-19中肺通气的模拟变化。阳性结果将支持倾向定位，即使在其他人群中。

方法：15例接受机械通气的COVID-19患者在气管插管后3天内以仰卧位和俯卧位接受了肺计算机断层扫描，并保持呼气末正压(PEEP)恒定。使用定量分析，我们测量了不通气、通气不良、通气良好和过度通气隔室的体积以及肺10个垂直水平的气体-组织比。此外，我们用10个垂直气体-组织比的标准化中位绝对偏差表示肺通气的异质性，较低值表示异质性较小。

结果：研究时，仰卧位PEEP为12(10-14)cmh2 O，pao2：fio2为107(84-173)mmHg。俯卧位时，不通气隔室的容积减少了82(26-147)ml，通气不良隔室的容积增加了82(53-174)ml，正常通气隔室的容积没有显著变化，过度通气隔室的容积减少了28(11-186)ml。在8例(53%)患者中，过度充气隔室的容积下降大于非充气隔室的容积。仰卧位时，肺的10个垂直水平的气体-组织比下降0.34(0.25-0.49)ml/g，俯卧位时下降0.03（-0.11至0.14）ml/g(p < 0.001)。这10个水平的气体-组织比的标准化中位绝对偏差在所有患者中均下降，从0.55(0.50-0.71)下降至0.20(0.14-0.27)(p < 0.001)。

结论：在15例COVID-19患者中，俯卧位减少了肺泡塌陷、过度充气和均质化肺通气。在其他ARDS患者中观察到了类似的反应，俯卧位改善了结局。因此，我们的数据提供了病理生理学依据，支持即使在COVID-19中的俯卧位。

## Machine learning derivation of four computable 24-h pediatric sepsis phenotypes to facilitate enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory clinical trials

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Thrombotic microangiopathy-induced thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and hyperinflammatory macrophage activation syndrome are important causes of late pediatric sepsis mortality that are often missed or have delayed diagnosis. The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions. 

METHODS: We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin. 

RESULTS: Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n = 135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n = 102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n = 56, 34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83-136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26-137.75], p < 0.0001). 

CONCLUSIONS: Four computable phenotypes are derived, with PedSep-D being optimal for enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory trials targeting thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and macrophage activation syndrome in pediatric sepsis. A computer tool for identification of individual patient membership ( www.pedsepsis.pitt.edu ) is provided. Reproducibility will be assessed at completion of two ongoing pediatric sepsis studies.

##中文标题- 机器学习推导出4个可计算的24h儿科脓毒症表型，以促进早期个体化抗炎临床试验的入组

**摘要**

背景：血栓性微血管病引起的血小板减少相关多器官功能衰竭和高炎性巨噬细胞活化综合征是儿科脓毒症晚期死亡的重要原因，常被漏诊或延误诊断。美国国立综合医学研究院败血症研究工作组建议，在现有临床数据集中应用新的研究方法，以提高败血症新疗法早期试验的效率。我们的目的是应用机器学习方法得出可计算的24h脓毒症表型，以促进靶向这些疾病的早期抗炎试验的个性化入组。

方法：我们对404名儿童现有的PHENOtyping脓毒症诱导的多器官衰竭研究(PHENOMS)数据集应用共识、k-means聚类分析。24小时可计算的表型是使用25个可用的床旁变量得出的，包括C-反应蛋白和铁蛋白。

结果：得出4个可计算表型（PedSep-A、B、C和D）。与所有其他表型相比，PedSep-A患者（n = 135；死亡率2%）更年轻且既往健康，C反应蛋白和铁蛋白水平最低，淋巴细胞和血小板计数最高，心率最高，肌酐最低(p < 0.05)；PedSep-B患者（n = 102；12%死亡率）最有可能插管，且格拉斯哥昏迷量表评分最低(p < 0.05)；PedSep-C患者（n = 110；死亡率10%）体温和格拉斯哥昏迷量表评分最高，肺衰竭最少，淋巴细胞计数最低(p < 0.05)；PedSep-D患者（n = 56，34%死亡率）的肌酐和器官衰竭数量最高，包括肾脏、肝脏和血液学器官衰竭，血小板计数最低(p < 0.05)。PedSep-D发生血小板减少相关多器官功能衰竭(Adj OR 47.51 95%CI[18.83-136.83]，p < 0.0001)和巨噬细胞活化综合征(Adj OR 38.63 95%CI[13.26-137.75]，p < 0.0001)的可能性最高。

结论：得出4个可计算的表型，PedSep-D是靶向血小板减少相关多器官功能衰竭和巨噬细胞活化综合征儿科脓毒症早期个体化抗炎试验的最佳入组患者。识别个体患者成员的计算机工具（www.pedsepsis.pitt.edu）。完成两项正在进行的儿科败血症研究时，将对重现性进行评估。

## Effects on health-related quality of life of interventions affecting survival in critically ill patients: a systematic review

**Abstract**

Survival has been considered the cornerstone for clinical outcome evaluation in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). There is evidence that ICU survivors commonly show impairments in long-term outcomes such as quality of life (QoL) considering them as the most relevant ones. In the last years, the concept of patient-important outcomes has been introduced and increasingly reported in peer-reviewed publications. In the present systematic review, we evaluated how many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted on critically ill patients and reporting a benefit on survival reported also data on QoL. All RCTs investigating nonsurgical interventions that significantly reduced mortality in critically ill patients were searched on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Embase from inception until August 2021. In a second stage, for all the included studies, the outcome QoL was investigated. The primary outcome was to evaluate how many RCTs analyzing interventions reducing mortality reported also data on QoL. The secondary endpoint was to investigate if QoL resulted improved, worsened or not modified. Data on QoL were reported as evaluated outcome in 7 of the 239 studies (2.9%). The tools to evaluate QoL and QoL time points were heterogeneous. Four interventions showed a significant impact on QoL: Two interventions improved survival and QoL (pravastatin in subarachnoid hemorrhage, dexmedetomidine in elderly patients after noncardiac surgery), while two interventions reduced mortality but negatively influenced QoL (caloric restriction in patients with refeeding syndrome and systematic ICU admission in elderly patients). In conclusion, only a minority of RCTs in which an intervention demonstrated to affect mortality in critically ill patients reported also data on QoL. Future research in critical care should include patient-important outcomes like QoL besides mortality. Data on this topic should be collected in conformity with PROs statement and core outcome sets to guarantee quality and comparability of results.

生存率被认为是重症监护室(ICU)重症患者临床结局评价的基础。有证据表明，ICU存活者通常表现出长期结局损害，如生活质量(QoL)，将其视为最相关的结局。在过去几年中，引入了患者重要结局的概念，并在同行评审出版物中报告越来越多。在本系统评价中，我们评估了在危重患者中进行的多少项随机对照试验(RCT)，并报告了生存获益，还报告了QoL数据。在MEDLINE/PubMed、Scopus和Embase中检索了从开始到2021年8月期间研究非手术干预显著降低危重患者死亡率的所有RCT。在第二阶段，对于所有纳入的研究，研究了结局QoL。主要结局是评估有多少项分析干预措施、降低死亡率的RCT报告了QoL数据。次要终点是调查QoL是否改善、恶化或未改变。239项研究中的7项(2.9%)将QoL数据报告为评价结局。评价QoL和QoL时间点的工具具有异质性。4种干预措施显示了对QoL的显著影响：2种干预改善了生存率和QoL（普伐他汀治疗蛛网膜下腔出血，右美托咪定治疗非心脏手术后的老年患者），尽管两种干预措施降低了死亡率，但对QoL（再喂养综合征患者的热量限制和老年患者系统ICU入院）产生了不良影响。总之，只有少数经证明干预可影响重症患者死亡率的RCT也报告了QoL数据。除了死亡率以外，重症监护的未来研究应包括患者重要结局，如QoL。应根据PRO声明和核心结局集收集关于该主题的数据，以确保结果的质量和可比性。

## Early intubation and decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Some academic organizations recommended that physicians intubate patients with COVID-19 with a relatively lower threshold of oxygen usage particularly in the early phase of pandemic. We aimed to elucidate whether early intubation is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who required intubation. 

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted at 66 hospitals in Japan where patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 were treated between January and September 2020. Patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19 with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test and intubated during admission were included. Early intubation was defined as intubation conducted in the setting of ≤ 6 L/min of oxygen usage. In-hospital mortality was compared between patients with early and non-early intubation. Inverse probability weighting analyses with propensity scores were performed to adjust patient demographics, comorbidities, hemodynamic status on admission and time at intubation, medications before intubation, severity of COVID-19, and institution characteristics. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of age, severity of hypoxemia at intubation, and days from admission to intubation. 

RESULTS: Among 412 patients eligible for the study, 110 underwent early intubation. In-hospital mortality was lower in patients with early intubation than those with non-early intubation (18 [16.4%] vs. 88 [29.1%]; odds ratio, 0.48 [95% confidence interval 0.27-0.84]; p = 0.009, and adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95% confidence interval 0.19-0.42]; p < 0.001). The beneficial effects of early intubation were observed regardless of age and severity of hypoxemia at time of intubation; however, early intubation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality only among patients who were intubated later than 2 days after admission. 

CONCLUSIONS: Early intubation in the setting of ≤ 6 L/min of oxygen usage was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19 who required intubation.

##中文标题- 2019年冠状病毒病患者的早期插管和住院死亡率降低

**摘要**

背景：一些学术组织建议医生使用相对较低的氧使用阈值对COVID-19患者进行插管，尤其是在大流行早期阶段。我们旨在阐明在2019年(COVID-19)需要插管的新型冠状病毒疾病患者中，早期插管是否与住院死亡率降低相关。

方法：在日本的66家医院进行了一项多中心、回顾性、观察性研究，其中中重度COVID-19患者在2020年1月至9月接受治疗。纳入了在入院期间被诊断为COVID-19、逆转录聚合酶链反应试验阳性和插管的患者。早期插管定义为在氧气利用率≤6 L/min的条件下进行插管。比较了早期和非早期插管患者的住院死亡率。使用倾向评分进行了逆概率加权分析，以调整患者人口统计学、合并症、入院时的血流动力学状态和插管时间、插管前用药、COVID-19的严重程度和机构特征。根据年龄、插管时低氧血症的严重程度和从入院到插管的天数进行了亚组分析。

结果：在符合研究条件的412例患者中，110例接受了早期插管。早期插管患者的院内死亡率低于非早期插管患者（18[16.4%]vs. 88[29.1%]；比值比，0.48[95%置信区间0.27-0.84]；p = 0.009，调整后的比值比，0.28[95%置信区间0.19-0.42]；p < 0.001）。无论年龄和插管时低氧血症的严重程度如何，均观察到了早期插管的有益作用；但是，仅在入院后2天以后接受插管的患者中，早期插管与较低的住院死亡率相关。

结论：在需要插管的COVID-19患者中，在氧气利用率≤6 L/min的情况下早期插管与住院死亡率降低相关。

## Comparison of the predictive ability of clinical frailty scale and hospital frailty risk score to determine long-term survival in critically ill patients: a multicentre retrospective cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is the most commonly used frailty measure in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) was recently proposed for the quantification of frailty. We aimed to compare the HFRS with the CFS in critically ill patients in predicting long-term survival up to one year following ICU admission. 

METHODS: In this retrospective multicentre cohort study from 16 public ICUs in the state of Victoria, Australia between 1st January 2017 and 30th June 2018, ICU admission episodes listed in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database registry with a documented CFS, which had been linked with the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset and the Victorian Death Index were examined. The HFRS was calculated for each patient using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes that represented pre-existing conditions at the time of index hospital admission. Descriptive methods, Cox proportional hazards and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to investigate the association between each frailty score and long-term survival up to 1 year, after adjusting for confounders including sex and baseline severity of illness on admission to ICU (Australia New Zealand risk-of-death, ANZROD). 

RESULTS: 7001 ICU patients with both frailty measures were analysed. The overall median (IQR) age was 63.7 (49.1-74.0) years; 59.5% (n = 4166) were male; the median (IQR) APACHE II score 14 (10-20). Almost half (46.7%, n = 3266) were mechanically ventilated. The hospital mortality was 9.5% (n = 642) and 1-year mortality was 14.4% (n = 1005). HFRS correlated weakly with CFS (Spearman's rho 0.13 (95% CI 0.10-0.15) and had a poor agreement (kappa = 0.12, 95% CI 0.10-0.15). Both frailty measures predicted 1-year survival after adjusting for confounders, CFS (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.21-1.31) and HFRS (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15). The CFS had better discrimination of 1-year mortality than HFRS (AUROC 0.66 vs 0.63 p < 0.0001). 

CONCLUSION: Both HFRS and CFS independently predicted up to 1-year survival following an ICU admission with moderate discrimination. The CFS was a better predictor of 1-year survival than the HFRS.

##中文标题- 比较临床虚弱量表与医院虚弱风险评分对确定危重患者长期生存的预测能力：一项多中心回顾性队列研究

**摘要**

背景：临床衰弱量表(CFS)是重症监护室(ICU)患者最常用的衰弱测量指标。最近提出采用医院虚弱风险评分(HFRS)对虚弱进行量化。我们旨在比较危重患者HFRS与CFS在预测入住ICU后1年内的长期生存率。

方法：在本项回顾性多中心队列研究中，研究于2017年1月1日至2018年6月30日在澳大利亚维多利亚州的16家公立ICU中，记录了CFS的澳大利亚和新西兰重症监护协会成人患者数据库登记研究的ICU入院发作，检查了与维多利亚州入院事件数据集和维多利亚州死亡指数相关的数据。使用疾病和有关健康问题的国际统计分类第10次修订版(ICD-10)代码计算每例患者的HFRS，这些代码代表在索引入院时的既存疾病。采用描述性方法、Cox比例风险和受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUROC)，在校正混杂因素（包括性别和入住ICU时的基线疾病严重程度）后，研究每个虚弱评分与长达1年的长期生存之间的相关性（澳大利亚、新西兰、ANZROD）。

结果：分析了7001例具有两种虚弱指标的ICU患者。总体中位(IQR)年龄为63.7(49.1-74.0)岁；59.5%(n = 4166)为男性；中位(IQR)APACHE II评分为14(10-20)。几乎一半(46.7%，n = 3266)为机械通气。住院死亡率为9.5%(n = 642)，1年死亡率为14.4%(n = 1005)。HFRS与CFS弱相关（Spearman rho 0.13(95%CI 0.10-0.15)，一致性较差(kappa = 0.12，95%CI 0.10-0.15)。在校正混杂因素CFS(HR 1.26，95%CI 1.21-1.31)和HFRS(HR 1.08，95%CI 1.02-1.15)后，两种虚弱指标均可预测1年生存率。CFS对1年死亡率的区分能力优于HFRS(AUROC 0.66 vs 0.63 p < 0.0001)。

结论：HFRS和CFS均可在中度区分度的情况下独立预测入住ICU后1年的生存率。CFS是比HFRS更好的1年生存率预测指标。

## Sequential use of midazolam and dexmedetomidine for long-term sedation may reduce weaning time in selected critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients: a randomized controlled study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Current sedatives have different side effects in long-term sedation. The sequential use of midazolam and dexmedetomidine for prolonged sedation may have distinct advantages. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the sequential use of midazolam and either dexmedetomidine or propofol, and the use of midazolam alone in selected critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. 

METHODS: This single-center, randomized controlled study was conducted in medical and surgical ICUs in a tertiary, academic medical center. Patients enrolled in this study were critically ill, mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving midazolam, with anticipated mechanical ventilation for ≥ 72 h. They passed the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) safety screen, underwent a 30-min-SBT without indication for extubation and continued to require sedation. Patients were randomized into group M-D (midazolam was switched to dexmedetomidine), group M-P (midazolam was switched to propofol), and group M (sedation with midazolam alone), and sedatives were titrated to achieve the targeted sedation range (RASS  - 2 to 0). 

RESULTS: Total 252 patients were enrolled. Patients in group M-D had an earlier recovery, faster extubation, and more percentage of time at the target sedation level than those in group M-P and group M (all P < 0.001). They also experienced less weaning time (25.0 h vs. 49.0 h; HR1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.06; P = 0.025), and a lower incidence of delirium (19.5% vs. 43.8%, P = 0.002) than patients in group M. Recovery (P < 0.001), extubation (P < 0.001), and weaning time (P = 0.048) in group M-P were shorter than in group M, while the acquisition cost of sedative drug was more expensive than other groups (both P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in adverse events among these groups (all P > 0.05). 

CONCLUSIONS: The sequential use of midazolam and dexmedetomidine was an effective and safe sedation strategy for long-term sedation and could provide clinically relevant benefits for selected critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients.

## Cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration and favorable neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide multicenter observational study in Japan (the JAAM-OHCA registry)

**Abstract**

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the association between cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR duration) and outcomes after OHCA. 

METHODS: This secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, observational study included adult non-traumatic OHCA patients aged ≥ 18 years between June 2014 and December 2017. CPR duration was defined as the time from professional CPR initiation to the time of return of spontaneous circulation or termination of resuscitation. The primary outcome was 1-month survival, with favorable neurological outcomes defined by cerebral performance category 1 or 2. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between CPR duration and favorable neurological outcomes. We also investigated the association between CPR duration and favorable neurological outcomes stratified by case features, including the first documented cardiac rhythm, witnessed status, and presence of bystander CPR. 

RESULTS: A total of 23,803 patients were included in this analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the probability of favorable neurological outcomes decreased with CPR duration (i.e., 20.8% [226/1084] in the ≤ 20 min group versus 0.0% [0/708] in the 91-120 min group, P for trend < 0.001). Furthermore, the impact of CPR duration differed depending on the presence of case features; those with shockable, witnessed arrest, and bystander CPR were more likely to achieve favorable neurological outcomes after prolonged CPR duration > 30 min. 

CONCLUSION: The probability of favorable neurological outcome rapidly decreased within a few minutes of CPR duration. But, the impact of CPR duration may be influenced by each patient's clinical feature.

##中文标题- 院外心脏骤停后心肺复苏持续时间和有利的神经系统结局：日本的一项全国多中心观察性研究（JAAM-OHCA登记研究）

**摘要**

目的：我们旨在评估心肺复苏（CPR持续时间）与OHCA后结局之间的相关性。

方法：一项前瞻性、多中心、观察性研究的二次分析纳入了2014年6月至2017年12月期间年龄≥18岁的成人非创伤性OHCA患者。CPR持续时间定义为从专业CPR开始到自主循环恢复或复苏终止的时间。主要结局为1个月生存率，神经系统结局定义为脑功能分级1或2。我们进行了有利的logistic回归分析，以研究CPR持续时间与有利的神经系统结局之间的相关性。我们还研究了CPR持续时间与按病例特征分层的有利神经系统结局之间的相关性，包括首次记录的心律、有目击者的状态和旁观者CPR的存在。

结果：共有23,803例患者纳入本分析。多变量逻辑回归分析表明，良好神经学结局的概率随CPR持续时间的延长而降低（即，≤20 min组中20.8%[226/1084]与91-120 min组中0.0%[0/708]，趋势P < 0.001）。延长CPR持续时间的影响取决于是否存在病例特征；在CPR持续时间 > 30 min后，具有可电击、有目击者的心脏骤停和旁观者CPR特征的患者更可能获得有利的神经系统结局。

结论：CPR持续时间几分钟内获得有利神经系统结局的概率。但是，CPR持续时间的影响可能受到每名患者临床特征的影响。

## Assessing the SAfety and FEasibility of bedside portable low-field brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging in patients on ECMO (SAFE-MRI ECMO study): study protocol and first case series experience

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: To assess the safety and feasibility of imaging of the brain with a point-of-care (POC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Early detection of acute brain injury (ABI) is critical in improving survival for patients with ECMO support. 

METHODS: Patients from a single tertiary academic ECMO center who underwent head CT (HCT), followed by POC brain MRI examinations within 24 h following HCT while on ECMO. Primary outcomes were safety and feasibility, defined as completion of MRI examination without serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcome was the quality of MR images in assessing ABIs. 

RESULTS: We report 3 consecutive adult patients (median age 47 years; 67% male) with veno-arterial (n = 1) and veno-venous ECMO (n = 2) (VA- and VV-ECMO) support. All patients were imaged successfully without SAEs. Times to complete POC brain MRI examinations were 34, 40, and 43 min. Two patients had ECMO suction events, resolved with fluid and repositioning. Two patients were found to have an unsuspected acute stroke, well visualized with MRI. 

CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with VA- or VV-ECMO support can be safely imaged with low-field POC brain MRI in the intensive care unit, allowing for the assessment of presence and timing of ABI.

**摘要**

背景：评估使用床旁(POC)磁共振成像(MRI)系统对接受体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)的患者进行脑部成像的安全性和可行性。早期检测急性脑损伤(ABI)对于提高ECMO支持患者的生存率至关重要。

方法：来自一个三级学术ECMO中心的患者，在ECMO期间接受头部CT(HCT)，然后在HCT后24h内接受POC脑部MRI检查。主要结局为安全性和可行性，定义为完成MRI检查且未发生严重不良事件(SAE)。次要结局是评估ABI时MR图像的质量。

结果：我们报告了连续3例成人患者（中位年龄47岁；67%男性），接受静脉-动脉(n = 1)和静脉-静脉ECMO(n = 2)（VA和VV-ECMO）支持。所有患者均成功成像，未发生SAE。完成POC脑部MRI检查的时间分别为34、40和43 min。2例患者出现ECMO吸入事件，补液和重新定位后缓解。发现2例患者发生了疑似急性卒中，MRI对其有很好的显示。

结论：在重症监护室中，接受VA-或VV-ECMO支持的成人患者可以安全地接受低场POC脑部MRI成像，允许评估ABI的存在和时间。

## Early prolonged prone position in noninvasively ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2-related moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure: clinical outcomes and mechanisms for treatment response in the PRO-NIV study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Whether prone position (PP) improves clinical outcomes in COVID-19 pneumonia treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is unknown. We evaluated the effect of early PP on 28-day NIV failure, intubation and death in noninvasively ventilated patients with moderate-to-severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia and explored physiological mechanisms underlying treatment response. 

METHODS: In this controlled non-randomized trial, 81 consecutive prospectively enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate-to-severe (paO2/FiO2 ratio < 200) acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with early PP + NIV during Dec 2020-May 2021were compared with 162 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia matched for age, mortality risk, severity of illness and paO2/FiO2 ratio at admission, treated with conventional (supine) NIV during Apr 2020-Dec 2020 at HUMANITAS Gradenigo Subintensive Care Unit, after propensity score adjustment for multiple baseline and treatment-related variables to limit confounding. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) was performed at baseline and at day 5. Ventilatory parameters, physiological dead space indices (DSIs) and circulating inflammatory and procoagulative biomarkers were monitored during the initial 7 days. 

RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis. NIV failure occurred in 14 (17%) of PP patients versus 70 (43%) of controls [HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.50; p < 0.0001]; intubation in 8 (11%) of PP patients versus 44 (30%) of controls [HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.55; p = 0.0012], death in 10 (12%) of PP patients versus 59 (36%) of controls [HR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.44; p < 0.0001]. The effect remained significant within different categories of severity of hypoxemia (paO2/FiO2 < 100 or paO2/FiO2 100-199 at admission). Adverse events were rare and evenly distributed. Compared with controls, PP therapy was associated with improved oxygenation and DSIs, reduced global LUS severity indices largely through enhanced reaeration of dorso-lateral lung regions, and an earlier decline in inflammatory markers and D-dimer. In multivariate analysis, day 1 CO2 response outperformed O2 response as a predictor of LUS changes, NIV failure, intubation and death. 

CONCLUSION: Early prolonged PP is safe and is associated with lower NIV failure, intubation and death rates in noninvasively ventilated patients with COVID-19-related moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Early dead space reduction and reaeration of dorso-lateral lung regions predicted clinical outcomes in our study population.

##中文标题- SARS-CoV-2相关中重度低氧性呼吸衰竭无创通气患者的早期延长俯卧位：PRO-NIV研究中的临床结局和治疗应答机制

**摘要**

背景：在接受无创通气(NIV)治疗的COVID-19肺炎中，俯卧位(PP)是否能改善临床结局尚不清楚。我们评估了早期PP对无创通气的COVID-19肺炎所致中重度急性低氧血症性呼吸衰竭患者28天NIV衰竭、插管和死亡的影响，并探讨了潜在治疗反应的生理机制。

方法：在这项对照的非随机试验中，在2020年12月至2021年5月期间，81例连续前瞻性入组的COVID-19肺炎和中度至重度（paO2/FiO2比值 < 200）急性低氧性呼吸衰竭患者接受早期PP + NIV治疗，与162例连续的年龄、死亡风险、在对多个基线和治疗相关变量进行倾向评分校正以限制混杂因素后，2020年4月2020日至2020年12月在HUMANITAS Gradenigo亚重症监护室采用常规（仰卧位）NIV治疗的入院时疾病严重程度和paO2/FiO2比值。在基线和第5天进行肺部超声检查(LUS)。在最初7天内监测通气参数、生理死腔指数(DSI)以及循环炎症和促凝生物标志物。

结果：意向治疗分析。14例(17%)PP患者与70例(43%)对照患者发生了NIV失败[HR = 0.32，95%CI 0.21-0.50；p < 0.0001]；8例(11%)PP患者与44例(30%)对照患者发生了插管[HR = 0.31，95%CI 0.18-0.55；p = 0.0012]；10例(12%)PP患者与59例(36%)对照患者发生了死亡[HR = 0.27，95%CI 0.17-0.44；p < 0.0001]。在低氧血症严重程度的不同类别中，该效应仍然显著（入院时paO2/FiO2 < 100或paO2/FiO2 100-199）。不良事件罕见且均匀分布。与对照组相比，PP治疗改善了氧合和DSIs，主要通过增强肺背侧区域再通气降低了整体LUS严重程度指数，并且炎症标志物和D-二聚体更早下降。在多变量分析中，作为LUS变化、NIV失败、插管和死亡的预测因子，第1天CO2反应优于O2反应。

结论：在COVID-19相关的中重度低氧血性呼吸衰竭无创通气患者中，早期延长PP是安全的，并且与较低的NIV衰竭、插管和死亡率相关。在我们的研究人群中，早期死腔减少和背外侧肺区域再通气可预测临床结局。

## Permissive azotemia during acute kidney injury enables more rapid renal recovery and less renal fibrosis: a hypothesis and clinical development plan

**Abstract**

Preclinical models of acute kidney injury (AKI) consistently demonstrate that a uremic milieu enhances renal recovery and decreases kidney fibrosis. Similarly, significant decreases in monocyte/macrophage infiltration, complement levels, and other markers of inflammation in the injured kidney are observed across multiple studies and species. In essence, decreased renal clearance has the surprising and counterintuitive effect of being an effective treatment for AKI. In this Perspective, the author suggests a hypothesis describing why the uremic milieu is kidney protective and proposes a clinical trial of 'permissive azotemia' to improve renal recovery and long-term renal outcomes in critically ill patients with severe AKI.

##中文标题- 急性肾损伤过程中的允许性氮质血症可使肾脏更快恢复，减少肾脏纤维化：一项假设和临床开发计划

**摘要**

急性肾损伤(AKI)的临床前模型一致表明，尿毒症环境可促进肾脏恢复并减少肾脏纤维化。同样，在多项研究和物种中观察到损伤肾脏的单核细胞/巨噬细胞浸润、补体水平和其他炎症标志物显著降低。本质上，肾脏清除率降低作为AKI的有效治疗方法具有令人惊讶和违反直觉的作用。在这一观点中，作者提出了一个假设，描述了为什么尿毒症环境具有肾脏保护作用，并提出了一项“允许性氮质血症”的临床试验，以改善重度AKI重症患者的肾脏恢复和长期肾脏结局。

## Identifying clinical subtypes in sepsis-survivors with different one-year outcomes: a secondary latent class analysis of the FROG-ICU cohort

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Late mortality risk in sepsis-survivors persists for years with high readmission rates and low quality of life. The present study seeks to link the clinical sepsis-survivors heterogeneity with distinct biological profiles at ICU discharge and late adverse events using an unsupervised analysis. 

METHODS: In the original FROG-ICU prospective, observational, multicenter study, intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis on admission (Sepsis-3) were identified (N = 655). Among them, 467 were discharged alive from the ICU and included in the current study. Latent class analysis was applied to identify distinct sepsis-survivors clinical classes using readily available data at ICU discharge. The primary endpoint was one-year mortality after ICU discharge. 

RESULTS: At ICU discharge, two distinct subtypes were identified (A and B) using 15 readily available clinical and biological variables. Patients assigned to subtype B (48% of the studied population) had more impaired cardiovascular and kidney functions, hematological disorders and inflammation at ICU discharge than subtype A. Sepsis-survivors in subtype B had significantly higher one-year mortality compared to subtype A (respectively, 34% vs 16%, p < 0.001). When adjusted for standard long-term risk factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, severity of illness, renal function and duration of ICU stay), subtype B was independently associated with increased one-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.74 (95% CI 1.16-2.60); p = 0.006). 

CONCLUSIONS: A subtype with sustained organ failure and inflammation at ICU discharge can be identified from routine clinical and laboratory data and is independently associated with poor long-term outcome in sepsis-survivors.

##中文标题- 确定具有不同1年结局的败血症存活者的临床亚型：FROG-ICU队列的次要潜伏类分析

**摘要**

背景：脓毒症幸存者的晚期死亡风险持续数年，再入院率高，生活质量低。本研究旨在通过无监督的分析，将临床脓毒症存活者的异质性与ICU出院时不同的生物学特征以及晚期不良事件联系起来。

方法：在最初的FROG-ICU前瞻性、观察性、多中心研究中，确认入住重症监护室(ICU)的脓毒症患者（脓毒症-3）(N = 655)。其中，467例存活出院并纳入本研究。采用ICU出院时的现成数据，应用潜在类分析确定不同的败血症存活者临床类别。主要终点为离开ICU后1年死亡率。

结果：在ICU出院时，使用15个容易获得的临床和生物学变量确定了两个不同的亚型（A和B）。分配至亚型B（研究人群的48%）的患者在ICU出院时的心血管和肾脏功能受损、血液学疾病和炎症多于亚型A。亚型B中的败血症存活者的一年死亡率显著高于亚型A（分别为34%vs 16%，p < 0.001）。当校正标准的长期风险因素（例如，年龄、合并症、疾病严重程度、肾功能和ICU住院时间）时，亚型B与一年死亡率增加独立相关（校正的风险比(HR)= 1.74(95%CI 1.16-2.60)；p = 0.006）。

结论：从常规临床和实验室数据中可以确定出ICU出院时存在持续器官衰竭和炎症的亚型，并且与败血症存活者的长期结局不良独立相关。

## Ultrasound localization of central vein catheter tip by contrast-enhanced transthoracic ultrasonography: a comparison study with trans-esophageal echocardiography

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: To assess the usefulness of pre-operative contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE) and post-operative chest-x-ray (CXR) for evaluating central venous catheter (CVC) tip placements, with trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) as gold standard. 

METHODS: A prospective single-center, observational study was performed in 111 patients requiring CVC positioning into the internal jugular vein for elective cardiac surgery. At the end of CVC insertion by landmark technique, a contrast-enhanced TTE was performed by both the apical four-chambers and epigastric bicaval acoustic view to assess catheter tip position; then, a TEE was performed and considered as a reference technique. A postoperative CXR was obtained for all patients. 

RESULTS: As per TEE, 74 (67%) catheter tips were correctly placed and 37 (33%) misplaced. Considering intravascular and intracardiac misplacements together, they were detected in 8 patients by CE-TTE via apical four-chamber view, 36 patients by CE-TTE via epigastric bicaval acoustic view, and 12 patients by CXR. For the detection of catheter tip misplacement, CE-TTE via epigastric bicaval acoustic view was the most accurate method providing 97% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and 92% diagnostic accuracy if compared with either CE-TTE via apical four-chamber view or CXR. Concordance with TEE was 79% (p < 0.001) for CE-TTE via epigastric bicaval acoustic view. 

CONCLUSIONS: The concordance between CE-TTE via epigastric bicaval acoustic view and TEE suggests the use of the former as a standard technique to ensure the correct positioning of catheter tip after central venous cannulation to optimize the use of hospital resources and minimize radiation exposure.

##中文标题- 经胸超声造影定位中心静脉导管尖端的研究：与经食管超声心动图的对比研究

**摘要**

背景：以经食管超声心动图(TEE)为金标准，评估术前对比度增强的经胸超声心动图(CE-TTE)和术后胸部x线(CXR)用于评价中心静脉导管(CVC)尖端置入的有用性。

方法：在111例需要将CVC定位到颈内静脉以进行择期心脏手术的患者中进行了一项前瞻性、单中心、观察性研究。在通过标志技术插入CVC结束时，通过心尖四腔和上腹部双腔声学切面进行对比增强TTE，以评估导管尖端位置；然后进行TEE，并将其视为参考技术。获得了所有患者的术后CXR。

结果：TEE显示，74个(67%)导管尖端正确放置，37个(33%)位置错误。综合考虑血管内和心内错位，心尖四腔心切面CE-TTE检出8例，上腹部双腔心切面CE-TTE检出36例，CXR检出12例。对于导管头端错位的检测，与通过心尖四腔心切面或CXR的CE-TTE相比，通过上腹部双腔心切面的CE-TTE是最准确的方法，提供了97%的灵敏度、90%的特异性和92%的诊断准确性。经上腹部双腔声学视图的CE-TTE与TEE的一致性为79%(p < 0.001)。

结论：CE-TTE腹上腔静脉声学造影与TEE的一致性提示使用前者作为标准技术，以确保中心静脉插管后导管尖端的正确定位，从而优化医院资源的使用并尽量减少辐射暴露。

## Volunteerism during humanitarian crises: a practical guide

**Abstract**

Volunteerism to provide humanitarian aid occurs in response to disasters, crises, and conflict. Each of those volunteerism triggers engenders personal risk borne by the healthcare volunteer while rendering aid and merit specific evaluation. Factors that impact decision-making with regard to volunteering are personal, structural and crisis specific. Practical approaches to travel and on-scene safety benefit volunteers and should inform planning and preparation for volunteerism-driven travel. These approaches include planning for evacuation and potential rescue. These unique skills and approaches are generally not part of medical education outside of military service. The global medical community, including medical professional organizations, should embrace this opportunity to improve medical education and professional development to support humanitarian aid volunteerism. Disaster, crisis, or conflict-driven healthcare volunteerism highlights the core elements of altruism, dedication, and humanity that permeate clinician's drive to render aid and save lives.

## The effect of treatment and clinical course during Emergency Department stay on severity scoring and predicted mortality risk in Intensive Care patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Treatment and the clinical course during Emergency Department (ED) stay before Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission may affect predicted mortality risk calculated by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-IV, causing lead-time bias. As a result, comparing standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) among hospitals may be difficult if they differ in the location where initial stabilization takes place. The aim of this study was to assess to what extent predicted mortality risk would be affected if the APACHE-IV score was recalculated with the initial physiological variables from the ED. Secondly, to evaluate whether ED Length of Stay (LOS) was associated with a change (delta) in these APACHE-IV scores. 

METHODS: An observational multicenter cohort study including ICU patients admitted from the ED. Data from two Dutch quality registries were linked: the Netherlands Emergency department Evaluation Database (NEED) and the National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) registry. The ICU APACHE-IV, predicted mortality, and SMR based on data of the first 24 h of ICU admission were compared with an ED APACHE-IV model, using the most deviating physiological variables from the ED or ICU. 

RESULTS: A total of 1398 patients were included. The predicted mortality from the ICU APACHE-IV (median 0.10; IQR 0.03-0.30) was significantly lower compared to the ED APACHE-IV model (median 0.13; 0.04-0.36; p < 0.01). The SMR changed from 0.63 (95%CI 0.54-0.72) to 0.55 (95%CI 0.47-0.63) based on ED APACHE-IV. Predicted mortality risk changed more than 5% in 321 (23.2%) patients by using the ED APACHE-IV. ED LOS > 3.9 h was associated with a slight increase in delta APACHE-IV of 1.6 (95% CI 0.4-2.8) compared to ED LOS < 1.7 h. 

CONCLUSION: Predicted mortality risks and SMRs calculated by the APACHE IV scores are not directly comparable in patients admitted from the ED if hospitals differ in their policy to stabilize patients in the ED before ICU admission. Future research should focus on developing models to adjust for these differences.

##中文标题- 急诊留观期间的治疗和临床过程对重症监护患者严重程度评分和死亡风险预测的影响

**摘要**

背景：入住重症监护室(ICU)前急诊(ED)期间的治疗和临床病程可能影响通过急性生理和慢性健康评估(APACHE)-IV计算的预测死亡风险，导致先导-时间偏倚。因此，如果医院之间的标准化死亡率比(SMR)在发生初始稳定的地区不同，可能很难对其进行比较。本研究的目的是评估如果用ED的初始生理变量重新计算APACHE-IV评分，预测的死亡风险会受到多大程度的影响。其次，评估ED住院时间(LOS)是否与这些APACHE-IV评分的变化(δ)相关。

方法：一项观察性多中心队列研究，包括从急诊科(ED)收治的ICU患者。来自2项荷兰质量登记研究的数据被链接：荷兰急诊科评价数据库(NEED)和国家重症监护评价(NICE)登记研究。使用最偏离ED或ICU的生理变量，将ICU的APACHE-IV、预测的死亡率和基于入住ICU前24h数据的SMR与ED的APACHE-IV模型进行比较。

结果：共纳入1398例患者。ICU APACHE-IV的预测死亡率（中位数0.10；IQR 0.03-0.30）显著低于ED APACHE-IV模型（中位数0.13；0.04-0.36；p < 0.01）。基于ED APACHE-IV，SMR由0.63(95%CI 0.54-0.72)变为0.55(95%CI 0.47-0.63)。通过使用ED APACHE-IV，321例(23.2%)患者的预测死亡风险变化超过5%。与ED LOS<1.7 h相比，ED LOS>3.9 h伴随着ΔAPACHE-IV轻微增加1.6(95%CI 0.4-2.8)。

结论：如果医院在进入ICU前稳定患者进入ED的政策不同，则通过APACHE IV评分计算的预测死亡风险和SMR在从ED入院的患者中不具有直接可比性。未来的研究应重点开发模型，以调整这些差异。

## Transcranial Doppler as a screening test to exclude intracranial hypertension in brain-injured patients: the IMPRESSIT-2 prospective multicenter international study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Alternative noninvasive methods capable of excluding intracranial hypertension through use of transcranial Doppler (ICPtcd) in situations where invasive methods cannot be used or are not available would be useful during the management of acutely brain-injured patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether ICPtcd can be considered a reliable screening test compared to the reference standard method, invasive ICP monitoring (ICPi), in excluding the presence of intracranial hypertension. 

METHODS: This was a prospective, international, multicenter, unblinded, diagnostic accuracy study comparing the index test (ICPtcd) with a reference standard (ICPi), defined as the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the condition of interest (i.e., intracranial hypertension). Acute brain-injured patients pertaining to one of four categories: traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke (IS) requiring ICPi monitoring, were enrolled in 16 international intensive care units. ICPi measurements (reference test) were compared to simultaneous ICPtcd measurements (index test) at three different timepoints: before, immediately after and 2 to 3 h following ICPi catheter insertion. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated at three different ICPi thresholds (> 20, > 22 and > 25 mmHg) to assess ICPtcd as a bedside real-practice screening method. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminative accuracy and predictive capability of ICPtcd. 

RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two patients were recruited for final analysis. Intracranial hypertension (> 22 mmHg) occurred in 87 patients (33.2%). The total number of paired comparisons between ICPtcd and ICPi was 687. The NPV was elevated (ICP > 20 mmHg = 91.3%, > 22 mmHg = 95.6%, > 25 mmHg = 98.6%), indicating high discriminant accuracy of ICPtcd in excluding intracranial hypertension. Concordance correlation between ICPtcd and ICPi was 33.3% (95% CI 25.6-40.5%), and Bland-Altman showed a mean bias of -3.3 mmHg. The optimal ICPtcd threshold for ruling out intracranial hypertension was 20.5 mmHg, corresponding to a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI 40.7-92.6%) and a specificity of 72% (95% CI 51.9-94.0%) with an AUC of 76% (95% CI 65.6-85.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: ICPtcd has a high NPV in ruling out intracranial hypertension and may be useful to clinicians in situations where invasive methods cannot be used or not available.

##中文标题- 经颅多普勒作为排除脑损伤患者颅内高压的筛选试验：IMPRESSIT-2前瞻性多中心国际研究

**摘要**

背景：在无法使用或无法获得侵入性方法的情况下，能够通过使用经颅多普勒(ICPtcd)排除颅内高压的替代非侵入性方法将有助于急性脑损伤患者的治疗。本研究的目的是确定与参考标准方法有创ICP监测(ICPi)相比，在排除颅内高压存在时，ICPtcd是否可视为可靠的筛选试验。

方法：这是一项前瞻性、国际、多中心、非盲、诊断准确性研究，比较索引试验(ICPtcd)与参考标准(ICPi)，定义为确定是否存在关注疾病（即颅内高压）的最佳可用方法。在16个国际重症监护室中入组了属于以下四个类别之一的急性脑损伤患者：创伤性脑损伤(TBI)、蛛网膜下腔出血(SAH)、需要ICPi监测的脑出血(ICH)或缺血性卒中(IS)。在3个不同的时间点比较ICPi测量值（参考试验）与同时ICPtcd测量值（指数试验）：ICPi导管插入之前、之后即刻和之后2-3h。在3种不同的ICPi阈值（> 20、> 22和 > 25 mmHg）下计算敏感性、特异性、阳性(PPV)和阴性预测值(NPV)，以评估ICPtcd作为床旁实践筛查方法。使用受试者工作特征(ROC)曲线分析和曲线下面积(AUC)评价ICPtcd的鉴别准确性和预测能力。

结果：招募了262例患者进行最终分析。87例患者(33.2%)发生颅内高压(> 22 mmHg)。ICPtcd和ICPi之间的配对比较总数为687。NPV升高（ICP > 20 mmHg = 91.3%，> 22 mmHg = 95.6%，> 25 mmHg = 98。6%），表明ICPtcd排除颅内高压的判别准确性高。ICPtcd和ICPi之间的一致性相关性为33.3%(95%CI 25.6-40.5%)，Bland-Altman显示平均偏倚为-3.3 mmHg。排除颅内高压的最佳ICPtcd阈值为20.5 mmHg，对应的敏感性为70%(95%CI 40.7-92.6%)，特异性为72%(95%CI 51.9-94.0%)，AUC为76%(95%CI 65.6-85.5%)。结论和相关性：ICPtcd在排除颅内高压症方面具有较高的NPV，在无法使用或无法获得侵入性方法的情况下可能对临床医生有用。

## High-flow nasal cannula versus conventional oxygen therapy in acute COPD exacerbation with mild hypercapnia: a multicenter randomized controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can improve ventilatory function in patients with acute COPD exacerbation. However, its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain. 

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted from July 2017 to December 2020 in 16 tertiary hospitals in China. Patients with acute COPD exacerbation with mild hypercapnia (pH ≥ 7.35 and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide > 45 mmHg) were randomly assigned to either HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who met the criteria for intubation during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure (intolerance and need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), length of hospital stay, hospital cost, mortality, and readmission at day 90. 

RESULTS: Among 337 randomized patients (median age, 70.0 years; 280 men [83.1%]; median pH 7.399; arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide 51 mmHg), 330 completed the trial. 4/158 patients on HFNC and 1/172 patient on conventional oxygen therapy met the criteria for intubation (P = 0.198). Patients progressed to NPPV in both groups were comparable (15 [9.5%] in the HFNC group vs. 22 [12.8%] in the conventional oxygen therapy group; P = 0.343). Compared with conventional oxygen therapy, HFNC yielded a significantly longer median length of hospital stay (9.0 [interquartile range, 7.0-13.0] vs. 8.0 [interquartile range, 7.0-11.0] days) and a higher median hospital cost (approximately $2298 [interquartile range, $1613-$3782] vs. $2005 [interquartile range, $1439-$2968]). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes between groups. 

CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center randomized controlled study, HFNC compared to conventional oxygen therapy did not reduce need for intubation among acute COPD exacerbation patients with mild hypercapnia. The future studies should focus on patients with acute COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35). However, because the primary outcome rate was well below expected, the study was underpowered to show a meaningful difference between the two treatment groups.

##中文标题- 高流量鼻导管与常规氧疗对COPD急性加重期并轻度高碳酸血症的多中心随机对照研究

**摘要**

背景：高流量鼻导管(HFNC)可改善COPD急性加重期患者的通气功能。但是，其对临床结局的影响仍不确定。

方法：本随机对照试验于2017年7月至2020年12月在全国16家三级医院进行。将伴有轻度高碳酸血症（pH≥7.35且动脉血二氧化碳分压 > 45 mmHg）的COPD急性加重患者随机分配至HFNC组或常规氧疗组。主要结局是住院期间满足插管标准的患者比例。次要结局包括治疗失败（不耐受和需要无创或有创通气）、住院时间、住院费用、死亡率和第90天再入院。

结果：在337例随机化患者中（中位年龄70.0岁；280例男性[83.1%]；中位pH值7.399；动脉血二氧化碳分压51 mmHg），330例完成了试验。4/158例HFNC患者和1/172例常规氧疗患者符合插管标准(P = 0.198)。两组中进展为NPPV的患者相当（HFNC组15例[9.5%]vs.常规氧疗组22例[12.8%]；P = 0.343）。与常规氧疗相比，HFNC产生显著更长的中位住院时间（9.0[四分位距，7.0-13.0]与8.0[四分位距，7.0-11.0]天）和更高的中位住院费用（约$2298[四分位距，$1613-$3782]与$2005[四分位距，$1439-$2968]）。组间其他次要结局无显著差异。

结论：在这项多中心随机对照研究中，与常规氧疗相比，HFNC未减少轻度高碳酸血症的急性COPD加重患者的插管需求。今后的研究重点应放在COPD急性加重伴呼吸性酸中毒(pH < 7.35)的患者上。但是，由于主要结局率远低于预期，研究没有足够的把握度显示两个治疗组之间有意义的差异。

## Serum IL-17 levels are higher in critically ill patients with AKI and associated with worse outcomes

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) antagonism in rats reduces the severity and progression of AKI. IL-17-producing circulating T helper-17 (TH17) cells is increased in critically ill patients with AKI indicating that this pathway is also activated in humans. We aim to compare serum IL-17A levels in critically ill patients with versus without AKI and to examine their relationship with mortality and major adverse kidney events (MAKE). 

METHODS: Multicenter, prospective study of ICU patients with AKI stage 2 or 3 and without AKI. Samples were collected at 24-48 h after AKI diagnosis or ICU admission (in those without AKI) [timepoint 1, T1] and 5-7 days later [timepoint 2, T2]. MAKE was defined as the composite of death, dependence on kidney replacement therapy or a reduction in eGFR of ≥ 30% from baseline up to 90 days following hospital discharge. 

RESULTS: A total of 299 patients were evaluated. Patients in the highest IL-17A tertile (versus lower tertiles) at T1 had higher acuity of illness and comorbidity scores. Patients with AKI had higher levels of IL-17A than those without AKI: T1 1918.6 fg/ml (692.0-5860.9) versus 623.1 fg/ml (331.7-1503.4), p < 0.001; T2 2167.7 fg/ml (839.9-4618.9) versus 1193.5 fg/ml (523.8-2198.7), p = 0.006. Every onefold higher serum IL-17A at T1 was independently associated with increased risk of hospital mortality (aOR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) and MAKE (aOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.02-1.55). The highest tertile of IL-17A (vs. the lowest tertile) was also independently associated with higher risk of MAKE (aOR 3.03, 95% CI: 1.34-6.87). There was no effect modification of these associations by AKI status. IL-17A levels remained significantly elevated at T2 in patients that died or developed MAKE. 

CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-17A levels measured by the time of AKI diagnosis or ICU admission were differentially elevated in critically ill patients with AKI when compared to those without AKI and were independently associated with hospital mortality and MAKE.

##中文标题- AKI重症患者的血清IL-17水平较高，且与较差结局相关

**摘要**

背景：大鼠白介素-17(IL-17)拮抗作用减轻了AKI的严重程度和进展。AKI重症患者中，产生IL-17的循环辅助性T细胞17(TH17)增加，表明该通路在人体中也被激活。我们旨在比较伴与不伴AKI的重症患者的血清IL-17A水平，并检查其与死亡率和主要不良肾脏事件(MAKE)的关系。

方法：多中心、前瞻性研究，无AKI的AKI的2期或3期ICU患者。在AKI诊断或入住ICU后24-48h（无AKI者）[时间点1，T1]和5-7天后[时间点2，T2]采集样本。MAKE定义为死亡、对肾脏替代治疗的依赖或出院后90天内eGFR较基线降低≥30%的复合终点。

结果：共评价了299例患者。T1时IL-17A最高四分位数（与较低四分位数相比）患者的疾病急性和合并症评分较高。AKI患者的IL-17A水平高于无AKI患者：T1 1918.6 fg/ml(692.0-5860.9)vs 623.1 fg/ml(331.7-1503.4)，p < 0.001；T2 2167.7 fg/ml(839.9-4618.9)vs 1193.5 fg/ml(523.8-2198.7)，p = 0.006。T1时血清IL-17A每升高1倍与住院死亡率(aOR 1.35，95%CI：1.06-1.73)和MAKE(aOR 1.26，95%CI：1.02-1.55)风险增加独立相关。IL-17A最高四分位数（相对于最低四分位数）也与MAKE风险升高独立相关(aOR 3.03，95%CI：1.34-6.87)。AKI状态对这些相关性无影响。在死亡或发生MAKE的患者中，IL-17A水平在T2时仍显著升高。

结论：AKI重症患者诊断AKI或入住ICU时测定的血清IL-17A水平与无AKI患者相比有差异升高，并与医院死亡率和MAKE独立相关。

## Closed-loop oxygen control improves oxygen therapy in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure patients under high flow nasal oxygen: a randomized cross-over study (the HILOOP study)

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the efficacy of a closed-loop oxygen control in critically ill patients with moderate to severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) treated with high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO). 

METHODS: In this single-centre, single-blinded, randomized crossover study, adult patients with moderate to severe AHRF who were treated with HFNO (flow rate ≥ 40 L/min with FiO(2) ≥ 0.30) were randomly assigned to start with a 4-h period of closed-loop oxygen control or 4-h period of manual oxygen titration, after which each patient was switched to the alternate therapy. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the individualized optimal SpO(2) range. 

RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included. Patients spent more time in the optimal SpO(2) range with closed-loop oxygen control compared with manual titrations of oxygen (96.5 [93.5 to 98.9] % vs. 89 [77.4 to 95.9] %; p < 0.0001) (difference estimate, 10.4 (95% confidence interval 5.2 to 17.2). Patients spent less time in the suboptimal range during closed-loop oxygen control, both above and below the cut-offs of the optimal SpO(2) range, and less time above the suboptimal range. Fewer number of manual adjustments per hour were needed with closed-loop oxygen control. The number of events of SpO(2) < 88% and < 85% were not significantly different between groups. 

CONCLUSIONS: Closed-loop oxygen control improves oxygen administration in patients with moderate-to-severe AHRF treated with HFNO, increasing the percentage of time in the optimal oxygenation range and decreasing the workload of healthcare personnel. These results are especially relevant in a context of limited oxygen supply and high medical demand, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

##中文标题- 在高流量鼻氧条件下，闭环式氧控制改善急性低氧血症性呼吸衰竭患者的氧疗：一项随机化交叉研究（HILOOP研究）

**摘要**

背景：我们旨在评估高流量鼻氧(HFNO)治疗的中度至重度急性低氧血症性呼吸衰竭(AHRF)重症患者中闭环氧气控制的疗效。

方法：在这项单中心、单盲、随机交叉研究中，接受HFNO治疗（FiO(2)流速≥40 L/min）的中重度AHRF成人患者被随机分配，开始4h的闭环氧气控制或4h的手动氧气滴定，此后，每例患者切换至替代治疗。主要结局是在个体化最佳SpO(2)范围内的时间百分比。

结果：纳入45例患者。与手动滴定氧气相比，闭环氧气控制患者处于最佳SpO(2)范围的时间更长(96.5[93.5-98.9]%vs. 89[77.4-95.9]%；p < 0.0001)（差异估计值，10.4[95%置信区间5.2-17.2]）。在闭环氧控制期间，患者处于次优范围的时间较少，高于和低于最佳SpO(2)范围的临界值，高于次优范围的时间较少。闭环氧气控制每小时所需的手动调整次数较少。SpO(2)< 88%和 < 85%的事件数量没有显著的组间差异。

结论：在接受HFNO治疗的中重度AHRF患者中，闭环氧气控制改善了氧气给药，增加了处于最佳氧合范围的时间百分比，并减少了医护人员的工作量。这些结果在氧气供应有限和医疗需求很高的情况下尤其相关，如COVID-19大流行。

## Derivation and performance of an end-of-life practice score aimed at interpreting worldwide treatment-limiting decisions in the critically ill

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Limitations of life-sustaining interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) exhibit substantial changes over time, and large, contemporary variation across world regions. We sought to determine whether a weighted end-of-life practice score can explain a large, contemporary, worldwide variation in limitation decisions. 

METHODS: The 2015-2016 (Ethicus-2) vs. 1999-2000 (Ethicus-1) comparison study was a two-period, prospective observational study assessing the frequency of limitation decisions in 4952 patients from 22 European ICUs. The worldwide Ethicus-2 study was a single-period prospective observational study assessing the frequency of limitation decisions in 12,200 patients from 199 ICUs situated in 8 world regions. Binary end-of-life practice variable data (1 = presence; 0 = absence) were collected post hoc (comparison study, 22/22 ICUs, n = 4592; worldwide study, 186/199 ICUs, n = 11,574) for family meetings, daily deliberation for appropriate level of care, end-of-life discussions during weekly meetings, written triggers for limitations, written ICU end-of-life guidelines and protocols, palliative care and ethics consultations, ICU-staff taking communication or bioethics courses, and national end-of-life guidelines and legislation. Regarding the comparison study, generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis was used to determine associations between the 12 end-of-life practice variables and treatment limitations. The weighted end-of-life practice score was then calculated using GEE-derived coefficients of the end-of-life practice variables. Subsequently, the weighted end-of-life practice score was validated in GEE analysis using the worldwide study dataset. 

RESULTS: In comparison study GEE analyses, end-of-life discussions during weekly meetings [odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.99], end-of-life guidelines [OR 0.52, (0.31-0.87)] and protocols [OR 15.08, (3.88-58.59)], palliative care consultations [OR 2.63, (1.23-5.60)] and end-of-life legislation [OR 3.24, 1.60-6.55)] were significantly associated with limitation decisions (all P < 0.05). In worldwide GEE analyses, the weighted end-of-life practice score was significantly associated with limitation decisions [OR 1.12 (1.03-1.22); P = 0.008]. 

CONCLUSIONS: Comparison study-derived, weighted end-of-life practice score partly explained the worldwide study's variation in treatment limitations. The most important components of the weighted end-of-life practice score were ICU end-of-life protocols, palliative care consultations, and country end-of-life legislation.

##中文标题- 旨在解释危重患者中全球治疗限制性决策的临终实践评分的推导和性能

**摘要**

背景：随着时间的推移，重症监护室(ICU)中维持生命的干预措施的局限性出现了实质性的变化，并且在世界范围内存在巨大的当代差异。我们试图确定加权临终实践评分是否能够解释限制决策中的巨大、当代、全球差异。

方法：2015-2016年(Ethicus-2)与1999-2000年(Ethicus-1)的比较研究是一项两阶段、前瞻性观察性研究，评估了来自22个欧洲ICU的4952例患者的限制决定的频率。全球Ethicus-2研究是一项单阶段前瞻性观察性研究，在8个世界地区199个ICU的12200例患者中评估了限制决策的频率。对家庭会议、适当护理水平的日常审议、每周会议期间的临终讨论、限制的书面触发因素进行事后分析（比较研究，22/22 ICU，n = 4592；全球研究，186/199 ICU，n = 11,574），收集二元临终实践变量数据（1 = 有；0 = 无），书面ICU临终指南和方案，姑息治疗和伦理咨询，ICU-工作人员参加沟通或生物伦理学课程，以及国家临终指南和立法。关于比较研究，使用广义估计方程(GEE)分析确定12项临终实践变量和治疗局限性之间的相关性。然后使用GEE衍生的临终实践变量系数计算加权的临终实践评分。随后，在GEE分析中使用全球研究数据集验证了加权临终实践评分。

结果：在比较研究GEE分析中，在每周会议[比值比(OR)0.55，95%置信区间(CI)0.30-0.99]、临终指南[OR 0.52，(0.31-0.87)]和方案[OR 15.08，(3.88-58.59)]、姑息治疗咨询[OR 2.63，(1.23-5.60)]和临终立法[OR 3.24，1.60-6.55）]与限制决定显著相关（所有P < 0.05）。在全球GEE分析中，加权临终实践评分与限制决策显著相关[OR 1.12(1.03-1.22)；P = 0.008]。

结论：比较研究得出的加权临终实践评分部分解释了全球研究治疗局限性的变化。加权临终实践评分的最重要组分为ICU临终方案、姑息治疗咨询和国家临终立法。

## Gut bacteriobiota and mycobiota are both associated with Day-28 mortality among critically ill patients

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Gut microbiota is associated with host characteristics such as age, sex, immune condition or frailty and is thought to be a key player in numerous human diseases. Nevertheless, its association with outcome in critically ill patients has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study is to assess the association between gut microbiota composition and Day-28 mortality in critically ill patients. 

METHODS: Rectal swab at admission of every patient admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) between October and November 2019 was frozen at - 80 °C. DNA extraction was performed thanks to QIAamp(®) PowerFecal(®) Pro DNA kit (QIAgen(®)). V3-V4 regions of 16SRNA and ITS2 coding genes were amplified by PCR. Sequencing (2x250 bp paired-end) was performed on MiSeq sequencer (Illumina(®)). DADA2 pipeline on R software was used for bioinformatics analyses. Risk factors for Day-28 mortality were investigated by logistic regression. 

RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were consecutively admitted to ICU of whom 13/57 (23%) deceased and 44/57 (77%) survived. Bacteriobiota α-diversity was lower among non-survivors than survivors (Shannon and Simpson index respectively, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001) as was mycobiota α-diversity (respectively p = 0.03 and p = 0.03). Both gut bacteriobiota and mycobiota Shannon index were independently associated with Day-28 mortality in multivariate analysis (respectively OR: 0.19, 97.5 CI [0.04-0.60], p < 0.01 and OR: 0.29, 97.5 CI [0.09-0.75], p = 0.02). Bacteriobiota β-diversity was significantly different between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.05) but not mycobiota β-diversity (p = 0.57). Non-survivors had a higher abundance of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Clostridiales sp. , Campylobacter ureolyticus, Akkermansia sp. , Malassezia sympodialis, Malassezia dermatis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas survivors had a higher abundance of Collinsella aerofaciens, Blautia sp. , Streptococcus sp. , Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium sp. 

CONCLUSION: The gut bacteriobiota and mycobiota α diversities are independently associated with Day-28 mortality in critically ill patients. The causal nature of this interference and, if so, the underlying mechanisms should be further investigated to assess if gut microbiota modulation could be a future therapeutic approach.

##中文标题- 肠道细菌生物门和霉菌生物门均与重症患者第28天死亡率相关

**摘要**

引言：肠道菌群与宿主特征有关，如年龄、性别、免疫状况或虚弱，被认为是许多人类疾病的关键因素。然而，尚未充分研究其与重症患者结局的相关性。本研究旨在评估重症患者肠道菌群组成与第28天死亡率之间的相关性。

方法：2019年10月至11月期间入住重症监护室(ICU)的每例患者入院时的直肠拭子在-80 ℃下冷冻。借助QIAamp(®)PowerFecal(®)Pro DNA试剂盒(QIAgen(®))进行DNA提取。PCR扩增16SRNA和ITS2编码基因的V3-V4区。使用MiSeq测序仪(Illumina(®))进行测序（2 x 250 bp配对末端）。使用R软件上的DADA2 pipeline进行生物信息学分析。通过logistic回归研究第28天死亡率的风险因素。

结果：57例患者连续进入ICU，其中13/57(23%)例死亡，44/57(77%)例存活。非存活者的细菌生物多样性α低于存活者（分别为Shannon和Simpson指数，p < 0.001和p = 0.001），真菌生物多样性α也是如此（分别为p = 0.03和p = 0.03）。在多变量分析中，肠道菌生物门和菌生物门Shannon指数均与第28天死亡率独立相关（分别为OR：0.19，97.5 CI[0.04-0.60]，p < 0.01和OR：0.29，97.5 CI[0.09-0.75]，p = 0.02）。存活者和非存活者之间的细菌生物多样性β-多样性存在显著差异(p = 0.05)，但不存在细菌生物多样性β-多样性(p = 0.57)。非存活者的溶血葡萄球菌、梭状芽孢杆菌的丰度更高。、解脲弯曲杆菌、Akkermansia sp.共生马拉色菌、皮炎马拉色菌和酿酒酵母，而存活者的产气Collinsella aerofaciens,Blautia sp.丰度较高。链球菌。Faecalibacterium prausnitzii和Bifidobacterium sp.

结论：危重患者肠道细菌生物型和霉菌生物型α多样性与Day-28死亡率独立相关。这种干扰的因果性质，如果是，应进一步研究潜在机制，以评估肠道菌群调节是否可作为未来的治疗方法。

## ICU bereaved surrogates' comorbid psychological-distress states and their associations with prolonged grief disorder

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Bereaved ICU family surrogates' psychological distress, e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is usually examined independently, despite the well-recognized comorbidity of these symptoms. Furthermore, the few studies exploring impact of psychological distress on development of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) did not consider the dynamic impact of symptom evolution. We identified surrogates' distinct patterns/states of comorbid psychological distress and their evolution over the first 3 months of bereavement and evaluated their associations with PGD at 6-month postloss. 

METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted on 319 bereaved surrogates. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and PGD were measured by the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale, and the PGD-13, respectively. Distinct psychological-distress states and their evolution were examined by latent transition analysis. Association between psychological-distress states and PGD symptoms was examined by logistic regression. 

RESULTS: Three distinct comorbid psychological-distress states (prevalence) were initially identified: no distress (56.3%), severe-depressive/borderline-anxiety distress (30.5%), and severe-anxiety/depressive/PTSD distress (13.3%). Except for those in the stable no-distress state, surrogates tended to regress to states of less psychological distress at the subsequent assessment. The proportion of participants in each psychological-distress state changed to no distress (76.8%), severe-depressive/borderline-anxiety distress (18.6%), and severe-anxiety/depressive/PTSD distress (4.6%) at 3-month postloss. Surrogates in the severe-depressive/borderline-anxiety distress and severe-anxiety/depressive/PTSD-distress state at 3-month postloss were more likely to develop PGD at 6-month postloss (OR [95%] = 14.58 [1.48, 143.54] and 104.50 [10.45, 1044.66], respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS: A minority of family surrogates of ICU decedents suffered comorbid severe-depressive/borderline-anxiety distress and severe-anxiety/depressive/PTSD symptoms during early bereavement, but they were more likely to progress into PGD at 6-month postloss.

##中文标题- ICU死者家属共患心理痛苦状态及其与长期悲伤障碍的关系

**摘要**

背景/目的：尽管公认伴随这些症状，但通常独立检查死者家属ICU替代者的心理压力，如焦虑、抑郁和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)。此外，探索心理应激对长期悲伤障碍(PGD)发展影响的少数研究未考虑症状演变的动态影响。我们确定了替代者在丧亲前3个月内共患心理应激的不同模式/状态及其演变，并评估了其与6个月后PGD的相关性。

方法：对319例丧亲者进行了纵向观察研究。分别通过医院焦虑抑郁量表、事件影响量表-修订版量表和PGD-13的焦虑和抑郁子量表测量焦虑、抑郁、PTSD和PGD的症状。通过潜伏转换分析检查了独特的心理-痛苦状态及其演变。通过logistic回归评估心理困扰状态和PGD症状之间的相关性。

结果：最初确定了三种不同的心理-应激共病状态（患病率）：无应激(56.3%)、重度抑郁/临界焦虑应激(30.5%)和重度焦虑/抑郁/PTSD应激(13.3%)。除了那些处于稳定无压力状态的患者，其他替代者在随后的评估中倾向于回归到较少心理压力的状态。在损失后3个月，每个心理-痛苦状态的参与者比例变为无痛苦(76.8%)、重度抑郁/临界焦虑痛苦(18.6%)和重度焦虑/抑郁/PTSD痛苦(4.6%)。在损失后3个月时处于重度抑郁/临界焦虑窘迫和重度焦虑/抑郁/PTSD-窘迫状态的替代者在损失后6个月时更有可能发生PGD（OR[95%]分别为14.58[1.48，143.54]和104.50[10.45，1044.66]）。

结论：在早期丧亲期间，ICU死者的少数家庭代理人共患重度-抑郁/边缘性焦虑窘迫和重度-焦虑/抑郁/PTSD症状，但他们在失去后6个月更可能进展为PGD。

## Plasma disappearance rate of albumin when infused as a 20% solution

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The transcapillary leakage of albumin is increased by inflammation and major surgery, but whether exogenous albumin also disappears faster is unclear. 

METHODS: An intravenous infusion of 3 mL/kg of 20% albumin was given over 30 min to 70 subjects consisting of 15 healthy volunteers, 15 post-burn patients, 15 patients who underwent surgery with minor bleeding, 10 who underwent surgery with major bleeding (mean, 1.1 L) and 15 postoperative patients. Blood Hb and plasma albumin were measured on 15 occasions over 5 h. The rate of albumin disappearance from the plasma was quantitated with population kinetic methodology and reported as the half-life (T(1/2)). 

RESULTS: No differences were observed for T(1/2) between volunteers, post-burn patients, patients who underwent surgery with minor bleeding and postoperative patients. The T(1/2) averaged 16.2 h, which corresponds to 3.8% of the amount infused per h. Two groups showed plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein of approximately 60 mg/L and still had a similarly long T(1/2) for albumin. By contrast, patients undergoing surgery associated with major hemorrhage had a shorter T(1/2), corresponding to 15% of the infused albumin per h. In addition, our analyses show that the T(1/2) differ greatly depending on whether the calculations consider plasma volume changes and blood losses. 

CONCLUSION: The disappearance rate of the albumin in 20% preparations was low in volunteers, in patients with moderately severe inflammation, and in postoperative patients.

##中文标题- 输注20%溶液时，白蛋白的血浆清除率

**摘要**

背景：炎症和大手术增加了白蛋白的经毛细血管渗漏，但外源性白蛋白是否也消失得更快尚不清楚。

方法：在30 min内对70名受试者进行20%白蛋白3 mL/kg静脉输注，包括15名健康志愿者、15名烧伤后患者、15名轻微出血手术患者、10名大出血手术患者（平均1.1 L）和15名术后患者。在5h内测量15次血液Hb和血浆白蛋白。使用群体动力学方法定量测定白蛋白从血浆中消失的速率，并报告为半衰期(T(1/2))。

结果：未观察到志愿者、烧伤后患者、轻度出血手术患者和术后患者之间的T(1/2)存在差异。T(1/2)平均为16.2h，相当于每小时输注量的3.8%。两组显示C反应蛋白的血浆浓度约为60 mg/L，但白蛋白的T(1/2)仍相似。相比之下，接受手术的大出血患者的T(1/2)较短，相当于每小时输注白蛋白的15%。此外，我们的分析表明，T(1/2)差异很大，取决于计算是否考虑血浆容量变化和失血量。

结论：在志愿者、中重度炎症患者和术后患者中，20%制剂的白蛋白消失率较低。

## A novel Vascular Leak Index identifies sepsis patients with a higher risk for in-hospital death and fluid accumulation

**Abstract**

PURPOSE: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is characterized by vascular leak. Treatment for sepsis, specifically intravenous fluids, may worsen deterioration in the context of vascular leak. We therefore sought to quantify vascular leak in sepsis patients to guide fluid resuscitation. 

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of sepsis patients in four ICU databases in North America, Europe, and Asia. We developed an intuitive vascular leak index (VLI) and explored the relationship between VLI and in-hospital death and fluid balance using generalized additive models (GAM). 

RESULTS: Using a GAM, we found that increased VLI is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Patients with a VLI in the highest quartile (Q4), across the four datasets, had a 1.61-2.31 times increased odds of dying in the hospital compared to patients with a VLI in the lowest quartile (Q1). VLI Q2 and Q3 were also associated with increased odds of dying. The relationship between VLI, treated as a continuous variable, and in-hospital death and fluid balance was statistically significant in the three datasets with large sample sizes. Specifically, we observed that as VLI increased, there was increase in the risk for in-hospital death and 36-84 h fluid balance. 

CONCLUSIONS: Our VLI identifies groups of patients who may be at higher risk for in-hospital death or for fluid accumulation. This relationship persisted in models developed to control for severity of illness and chronic comorbidities.

##中文标题- 新型血管渗漏指数确定了院内死亡和液体蓄积风险更高的败血症患者

**摘要**

目的：脓毒症是全球发病和死亡的主要原因，表现为血管渗漏。败血症治疗，尤其是静脉补液，可能在血管渗漏的情况下恶化。因此，我们试图对脓毒症患者的血管渗漏进行定量，以指导液体复苏。

方法：我们对北美、欧洲和亚洲四个ICU数据库中的败血症患者进行了一项回顾性队列研究。我们开发了一种直观的血管渗漏指数(VLI)，并使用广义相加模型(GAM)探讨了VLI与住院期间死亡和体液平衡之间的关系。

结果：使用GAM，我们发现VLI增加与住院死亡风险增加相关。在4个数据集中，VLI在最高四分位数(Q4)的患者与VLI在最低四分位数(Q1)的患者相比，在医院死亡的几率增加1.61-2.31倍。VLI Q2和Q3也与死亡几率增加相关。在大样本量的3个数据集中，VLI（作为连续变量）与住院期间死亡和体液平衡之间的关系具有统计学意义。具体而言，我们观察到，随着VLI的增加，住院期间死亡和36-84h液体平衡的风险增加。

结论：我们的VLI确定了院内死亡或液体蓄积风险更高的患者组。这种关系在用于控制疾病严重程度和慢性合并症的模型中持续存在。

PURPOSE: To assess the performance of the post-cardiac arrest (CA) prognostication strategy algorithm recommended by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) in 2020. 

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the Korean Hypothermia Network Prospective Registry 1.0. Unconscious patients without confounders at day 4 (72-96 h) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were included. The association between the prognostic factors included in the prognostication strategy algorithm, except status myoclonus and the neurological outcome, was investigated, and finally, the prognostic performance of the prognostication strategy algorithm was evaluated. Poor outcome was defined as cerebral performance categories 3-5 at 6 months after ROSC. 

RESULTS: A total of 660 patients were included in the final analysis. Of those, 108 (16.4%) patients had a good neurological outcome at 6 months after CA. The 2020 ERC/ESICM prognostication strategy algorithm identified patients with poor neurological outcome with 60.2% sensitivity (95% CI 55.9-64.4) and 100% specificity (95% CI 93.9-100) among patients who were unconscious or had a GCS_M score ≤ 3 and with 58.2% sensitivity (95% CI 53.9-62.3) and 100% specificity (95% CI 96.6-100) among unconscious patients. When two prognostic factors were combined, any combination of prognostic factors had a false positive rate (FPR) of 0 (95% CI 0-5.6 for combination of no PR/CR and poor CT, 0-30.8 for combination of No SSEP N20 and NSE 60). 

CONCLUSION: The 2020 ERC/ESICM prognostication strategy algorithm predicted poor outcome without an FPR and with sensitivities of 58.2-60.2%. Any combinations of two predictors recommended by ERC/ESICM showed 0% of FPR.

##中文标题- 心脏骤停后2020 ERC/ESICM预后策略算法的外部验证

**摘要**

目的：评估2020年欧洲复苏委员会(ERC)和欧洲重症监护医学学会(ESICM)推荐的心脏骤停后(CA)预测策略算法的性能。

方法：这是一项对韩国低温网络前瞻性注册1.0进行的回顾性分析。纳入自主循环恢复(ROSC)后第4天(72-96h)无混杂因素的意识丧失患者。研究了纳入预后策略算法的预后因素（除肌阵挛状态外）与神经系统结局之间的相关性，最后，评价了预后策略算法的预后性能。结局较差定义为ROSC后6个月时的脑功能分级3-5。

结果：最终分析共纳入660例患者。其中，108例(16.4%)患者在CA后6个月时具有良好的神经系统结局。2020 ERC/ESICM预后策略算法确定神经系统结局较差的患者，在意识不清或GCS_M评分≤3的患者中，敏感性为60.2%(95%CI 55.9-64.4)，特异性为100%(95%CI 93.9-100)；在意识不清或GCS_M评分≤3的患者中，敏感性为58.2%(95%CI 53.9-62.3)，特异性为100%(95%CI 96.6-100)。传染性患者。合并两个预后因素时，任何预后因素组合的假阳性率(FPR)均为0（无PR/CR和不良CT组合的95%CI 0-5.6，无SSEP N20和NSE 60组合的95%CI 0-30.8）。

结论：2020 ERC/ESICM预后策略算法预测结局较差，无FPR，敏感性为58.2%-60.2%。ERC/ESICM推荐的两种预测因子的任何组合均显示0%的FPR。

## Auxora vs placebo for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a randomized-controlled clinical trial.

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel inhibitors block proinflammatory cytokine release, preserve endothelial integrity and may effectively treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. 

METHODS: CARDEA was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the addition of Auxora, a CRAC channel inhibitor, to corticosteroids and standard of care in adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were adults with ≥ 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing using polymerase chain reaction or other assay, and pneumonia documented by chest imaging. Patients were also required to be receiving oxygen therapy using either a high flow or low flow nasal cannula at the time of enrolment and have at the time of enrollment a baseline imputed PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio > 75 and ≤ 300. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) was imputed from a SpO(2)/FiO(2) determine by pulse oximetry using a non-linear equation. Patients could not be receiving either non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of enrolment. The primary endpoint was time to recovery through Day 60, with secondary endpoints of all-cause mortality at Day 60 and Day 30. Due to declining rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and utilization of standard of care medications prohibited by regulatory guidance, the trial was stopped early. 

RESULTS: The pre-specified efficacy set consisted of the 261 patients with a baseline imputed PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤ 200 with 130 and 131 in the Auxora and placebo groups, respectively. Time to recovery was 7 vs. 10 days (P = 0.0979) for patients who received Auxora vs. placebo, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate at Day 60 was 13.8% with Auxora vs. 20.6% with placebo (P = 0.1449); Day 30 all-cause mortality was 7.7% and 17.6%, respectively (P = 0.0165). Similar trends were noted in all randomized patients, patients on high flow nasal cannula at baseline or those with a baseline imputed PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 100. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were less frequent in patients treated with Auxora vs. placebo and occurred in 34 patients (24.1%) receiving Auxora and 49 (35.0%) receiving placebo (P = 0.0616). The most common SAEs were respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumonia. 

CONCLUSIONS: Auxora was safe and well tolerated with strong signals in both time to recovery and all-cause mortality through Day 60 in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Further studies of Auxora in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are warranted.

##中文标题- Auxora对比安慰剂治疗重度COVID-19肺炎患者：一项随机对照临床试验。

**摘要**

背景：钙释放激活钙(CRAC)通道抑制剂阻滞促炎性细胞因子释放，保留内皮完整性，可有效治疗重症COVID-19肺炎患者。

方法：CARDEA是一项2期、随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验，在重度COVID-19肺炎成人患者中评价在皮质类固醇和标准治疗中添加CRAC通道抑制剂Auxora。符合条件的患者是具有≥1种符合COVID-19感染的症状、经聚合酶链反应实验室检查或其他试验证实诊断为COVID-19和胸部影像学证实的肺炎的成人患者。在入组时还要求患者使用高流量或低流量鼻插管接受氧疗，并且在入组时基线插补PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值 > 75且≤300。PaO(2)/FiO(2)通过脉搏血氧仪使用非线性方程测定的SpO(2)/FiO(2)进行插补。入组时，患者不能接受无创或有创机械通气。主要终点为至恢复时间至第60天，次要终点为第60天和第30天的全因死亡率。由于COVID-19住院率下降和使用监管指南禁止的标准治疗药物，试验提前终止。

结果：预先规定的疗效集包括261名基线插补PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤200的患者，Auxora和安慰剂组分别为130和131名。接受Auxora和安慰剂的患者至痊愈的时间分别为7天和10天(P = 0.0979)。Auxora组和安慰剂组第60天的全因死亡率分别为13.8%和20.6%(P = 0.1449)；第30天的全因死亡率分别为7.7%和17.6%(P = 0.0165)。在所有随机化患者、基线时接受高流量鼻插管或基线插补PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100的患者中观察到相似的趋势。Auxora治疗患者的严重不良事件(SAE)发生率低于安慰剂治疗患者，Auxora治疗组有34例患者(24.1%)发生SAE，安慰剂组有49例患者(35.0%)发生SAE(P = 0.0616)。最常见的SAE是呼吸衰竭、急性呼吸窘迫综合征和肺炎。

结论：在重度COVID-19肺炎患者中，Auxora是安全的，耐受性良好，至恢复时间和至第60天的全因死亡率均有很强的信号。有必要在重度COVID-19肺炎患者中进行Auxora的进一步研究。

## EXpert consensus On Diaphragm UltraSonography in the critically ill (EXODUS): a Delphi consensus statement on the measurement of diaphragm ultrasound-derived parameters in a critical care setting

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Diaphragm ultrasonography is rapidly evolving in both critical care and research. Nevertheless, methodologically robust guidelines on its methodology and acquiring expertise do not, or only partially, exist. Therefore, we set out to provide consensus-based statements towards a universal measurement protocol for diaphragm ultrasonography and establish key areas for research. 

METHODS: To formulate a robust expert consensus statement, between November 2020 and May 2021, a two-round, anonymous and online survey-based Delphi study among experts in the field was performed. Based on the literature review, the following domains were chosen: "Anatomy and physiology", "Transducer Settings", "Ventilator Impact", "Learning and expertise", "Daily practice" and "Future directions". Agreement of ≥ 68% (≥ 10 panelists) was needed to reach consensus on a question. 

RESULTS: Of 18 panelists invited, 14 agreed to participate in the survey. After two rounds, the survey included 117 questions of which 42 questions were designed to collect arguments and opinions and 75 questions aimed at reaching consensus. Of these, 46 (61%) consensus was reached. In both rounds, the response rate was 100%. Among others, there was agreement on measuring thickness between the pleura and peritoneum, using > 10% decrease in thickness as cut-off for atrophy and using 40 examinations as minimum training to use diaphragm ultrasonography in clinical practice. In addition, key areas for research were established. 

CONCLUSION: This expert consensus statement presents the first set of consensus-based statements on diaphragm ultrasonography methodology. They serve to ensure high-quality and homogenous measurements in daily clinical practice and in research. In addition, important gaps in current knowledge and thereby key areas for research are established.

**摘要**

背景：膈肌超声检查在重症监护和研究中均迅速发展。然而，关于其方法学和获得专业知识的方法学稳健指南并不存在，或仅部分存在。因此，我们致力于为膈肌超声检查的通用测量方案提供基于共识的声明，并确立研究的关键领域。

方法：为了制定稳健的专家共识声明，在2020年11月至2021年5月之间，在该领域的专家中进行了两轮、匿名和在线调查Delphi研究。根据文献综述，选择了以下领域：“解剖学和生理学”、“传感器设置”、“呼吸机影响”、“学习和专业知识”、“日常实践”和“未来方向”。需要获得≥68%（≥10名小组成员）的一致率才能就该问题达成共识。

结果：在邀请的18名小组成员中，14名同意参与调查。经过两轮调查后，调查包括117个问题，其中42个问题旨在收集论点和意见，75个问题旨在达成共识。其中，46例(61%)达成共识。两轮的应答率均为100%。在其他方面，胸膜和腹膜之间的厚度测量一致，使用厚度减少 > 10%作为萎缩的临界值，使用40项检查作为临床实践中使用隔膜超声检查的最低培训。此外，还确定了研究的关键领域。

结论：本专家共识声明提出了第一组基于共识的隔膜超声检查方法声明。它们用于确保日常临床实践和研究中高质量和同质的测量。此外，现有知识存在重要差距，因此确定了研究的关键领域。

## Association between timing of speech and language therapy initiation and outcomes among post-extubation dysphagia patients: a multicenter retrospective cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Post-extubation dysphagia (PED) is recognized as a common complication in the intensive care unit (ICU). Speech and language therapy (SLT) can potentially help improve PED; however, the impact of the timing of SLT initiation on persistent PED has not been well investigated. This study aimed to examine the timing of SLT initiation and its effect on patient outcomes after extubation in the ICU. 

METHODS: We conducted this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, collecting data from eight ICUs in Japan. Patients aged ≥ 20 years with orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 h, and those who received SLT due to PED, defined as patients with modified water swallowing test scores of 3 or lower, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia at hospital discharge, defined as functional oral intake scale score < 5 or death after extubation. Secondary outcomes included dysphagia or death at the seventh, 14th, or 28th day after extubation, aspiration pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality. Associations between the timing of SLT initiation and outcomes were determined using multivariable logistic regression. 

RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included. Of them, 82 (30.1%) patients exhibited dysphagia or death at hospital discharge, and their time spans from extubation to SLT initiation were 1.0 days. The primary outcome revealed that every day of delay in SLT initiation post-extubation was associated with dysphagia or death at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18). Similarly, secondary outcomes showed associations between this per day delay in SLT initiation and dysphagia or death at the seventh day (AOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.55), 14th day (AOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.58), or 28th day (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36) after extubation and occurrence of aspiration pneumonia (AOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17), while per day delay in post-extubation SLT initiation did not affect in-hospital mortality (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12). 

CONCLUSIONS: Delayed initiation of SLT in PED patients was associated with persistent dysphagia or death. Early initiation of SLT may prevent this complication post-extubation. A randomized controlled study is needed to validate these results.

##中文标题- 拔管后吞咽困难患者中语言和语言治疗开始的时间与结局的相关性：一项多中心回顾性队列研究

**摘要**

背景：拔管后吞咽困难(PED)是重症监护室(ICU)公认的常见并发症。语言和语言治疗(SLT)可能有助于改善PED；但是，尚未充分研究SLT启动时间对持续性PED的影响。本研究旨在检查在ICU开始SLT的时间及其对拔管后患者结局的影响。

方法：我们进行了这项多中心、回顾性、队列研究，收集了日本8间ICU的数据。年龄≥20岁、经口腔气管插管和机械通气超过48 h的患者，以及由于PED接受SLT的患者，定义为改良水吞咽试验评分≤3的患者。主要结局是出院时的吞咽困难，定义为功能性口服摄入量量表评分 < 5或拔管后死亡。次要结局包括拔管后第7、14或28天的吞咽困难或死亡、吸入性肺炎和住院死亡率。使用多变量logistic回归确定SLT开始时间与结局之间的相关性。

结果：共纳入272例患者。其中，82例(30.1%)患者在出院时显示了吞咽困难或死亡，其从拔管到开始SLT的时间间隔为1.0天。主要结局显示，拔管后开始SLT延迟的每一天均与出院时吞咽困难或死亡相关（调整比值比(AOR)，1.09；95%CI，1.02-1.18）。同样，次要结局显示每天延迟开始SLT与拔管后第7天(AOR，1.28；95%CI，1.05-1.55)、第14天(AOR，1.34；95%CI，1.13-1.58)或第28天(AOR，1.21；95%CI，1.07-1.36)吞咽困难或死亡以及吸入性肺炎的发生(AOR，1.09；95%CI，1.02-1.17)之间存在相关性，而拔管后开始SLT每天延迟不影响住院死亡率(AOR，1.04；95%CI，0.97-1.12)。

结论：PED患者延迟开始SLT与持续吞咽困难或死亡相关。早期启动SLT可预防这种拔管后并发症。需要一项随机对照研究来验证这些结果。

## Amniotic fluid embolism rescued by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but often catastrophic complication of pregnancy that leads to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Although few case reports have reported successful use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with AFE, concerns can be raised about the increased bleeding risks with that device. 

METHODS: This study included patients with AFE rescued by VA-ECMO hospitalized in two high ECMO volume centers between August 2008 and February 2021. Clinical characteristics, critical care management, in-intensive care unit (ICU) complications, and hospital outcomes were collected. ICU survivors were assessed for health-related quality of life (HRQL) in May 2021. 

RESULTS: During that 13-year study period, VA-ECMO was initiated in 54 parturient women in two high ECMO volume centers. Among that population, 10 patients with AFE [median (range) age 33 (24-40), SAPS II at 69 (56-81)] who fulfilled our diagnosis criteria were treated with VA-ECMO. Pregnancy evolved for 36 (30-41) weeks. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest before ECMO and two were cannulated under cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pre-ECMO hemodynamic was severely impaired with an inotrope score at 370 (55-1530) μg/kg/min, a severe left ventricular ejection fraction measured at 14 (0-40)%, and lactate at 12 (2-30) mmol/L. 70% of these patients were alive at hospital discharge despite an extreme pre-ECMO severity and massive blood product transfusion. However, HRQL was lower than age-matched controls and still profoundly impaired in the role-physical, bodily pain, and general health components after a median of 44 months follow-up. 

CONCLUSION: In this rare per-delivery complication, our results support the use of VA-ECMO despite intense DIC and ongoing bleeding. Future studies should focus on customized, patient-centered, rehabilitation programs that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.

##中文标题- 静脉-动脉体外膜肺氧合抢救羊水栓塞

**摘要**

背景：羊水栓塞(AFE)是一种罕见但通常具有灾难性的妊娠并发症，可导致心肺功能障碍和重度弥漫性血管内凝血(DIC)。尽管很少有病例报告成功使用静脉-动脉体外膜肺氧合(VA-ECMO)联合AFE，但可能会引起对该器械增加出血风险的担忧。

方法：本研究纳入2008年8月至2021年2月在两家高ECMO容量中心住院的经VA-ECMO抢救的AFE患者。收集临床特征、重症监护管理、重症监护病房(ICU)并发症和住院结局。2021年5月，对ICU幸存者的健康相关生活质量(HRQL)进行了评估。

结果：在这13年的研究期间，在两家高ECMO量中心的54名产妇中启动了VA-ECMO。在该人群中，10例符合我们诊断标准的AFE[中位（范围）年龄33(24-40)岁，SAPS II 69(56-81)岁]患者接受了VA-ECMO治疗。妊娠持续36(30-41)周。7例患者在ECMO前出现心脏骤停，2例在心肺复苏下插管。ECMO前的血液动力学严重受损，正性肌力评分为370(55-1530)μg/kg/min，重度左心室射血分数为14(0-40)%，乳酸盐为12(2-30)mmol/L。这些患者中有70%在出院时存活，尽管ECMO前的严重程度很高，且进行了大量的血液制品输注。然而，HRQL低于年龄匹配的对照组，并且在中位随访期44个月后，在身体角色、身体疼痛和一般健康方面仍有明显损害。

结论：在这种罕见的分娩并发症中，我们的结果支持使用VA-ECMO，尽管发生了强烈的DIC和持续出血。未来的研究应着重于定制的、以患者为中心的康复项目，这些项目可改善该人群的HRQL。

## Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome in Poland: a multicenter cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In Poland, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain unknown. This study aimed to answer these unknowns by analyzing data collected from high-volume ECMO centers willing to participate in this project. 

METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study was completed between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021 (15 months). Data from all patients treated with ECMO for COVID-19 were analyzed. Pre-ECMO laboratory and treatment data were compared between non-survivors and survivors. Independent predictors for death in the intensive care unit (ICU) were identified. 

RESULTS: There were 171 patients admitted to participating centers requiring ECMO for refractory hypoxemia due to COVID-19 during the defined time period. A total of 158 patients (mean age: 46.3 ± 9.8 years) were analyzed, and 13 patients were still requiring ECMO at the end of the observation period. Most patients (88%) were treated after October 1, 2020, 77.8% were transferred to ECMO centers from another facility, and 31% were transferred on extracorporeal life support. The mean duration of ECMO therapy was 18.0 ± 13.5 days. The crude ICU mortality rate was 74.1%. In the group of 41 survivors, 37 patients were successfully weaned from ECMO support and four patients underwent a successful lung transplant. In-hospital death was independently associated with pre-ECMO lactate level (OR 2.10 per 1 mmol/L, p = 0.017) and BMI (OR 1.47 per 5 kg/m(2), p = 0.050). 

CONCLUSIONS: The ICU mortality rate among patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 in Poland was high. In-hospital death was independently associated with increased pre-ECMO lactate levels and BMI.

##中文标题- 体外膜肺氧合治疗波兰重度COVID-19相关急性呼吸窘迫综合征：一项多中心队列研究

**摘要**

背景：在波兰，需要体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)的COVID-19患者的临床特征和结局仍未知。本研究旨在通过分析从愿意参加本项目的高容量ECMO中心收集的数据来回答这些未知。

方法：这项回顾性、多中心队列研究在2020年3月1日至2021年5月31日（15个月）之间完成。分析了因COVID-19接受ECMO治疗的所有患者的数据。比较非存活者和存活者之间的ECMO前实验室和治疗数据。确定了重症监护室(ICU)死亡的独立预测因素。

结果：在定义的时间段内，由于COVID-19导致的难治性低氧血症，有171例患者入住参与的中心需要ECMO。共分析了158例患者（平均年龄：46.3±9.8岁），13例患者在观察期结束时仍需ECMO治疗。大多数患者(88%)在2020年10月1日后接受治疗，77.8%从另一家机构转至ECMO中心，31%转至体外生命支持。ECMO治疗的平均持续时间为18.0±13.5天。ICU粗死亡率为74.1%。在41名存活者中，37名患者成功脱离ECMO支持，4名患者成功进行了肺移植。院内死亡与ECMO前乳酸水平(OR 2.10/1 mmol/L，p = 0.017)和BMI(OR 1.47/5 kg/m2，p = 0.050)独立相关。

结论：波兰COVID-19需要ECMO的患者中ICU死亡率较高。住院期间死亡与ECMO前乳酸水平和BMI增加独立相关。

## Intensive care-related loss of quality of life and autonomy at 6 months post-discharge: Does COVID-19 really make things worse?

**Abstract**

OBJECTIVE: To compare old patients hospitalized in ICU for respiratory distress due to COVID-19 with old patients hospitalized in ICU for a non-COVID-19-related reason in terms of autonomy and quality of life. DESIGN: Comparison of two prospective multi-centric studies. SETTING: This study was based on two prospective multi-centric studies, the Senior-COVID-Rea cohort (COVID-19-diagnosed ICU-admitted patients aged over 60) and the FRAGIREA cohort (ICU-admitted patients aged over 70). PATIENTS: We included herein the patients from both cohorts who had been evaluated at day 180 after admission (ADL score and quality of life). INTERVENTIONS: None. 

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 93 COVID-19 patients and 185 control-ICU patients were included. Both groups were not balanced on age, body mass index, mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and ADL and SAPS II scores. We modeled with ordered logistic regression the influence of COVID-19 on the quality of life and the ADL score. After adjustment on these factors, we observed COVID-19 patients were less likely to have a loss of usual activities (aOR [95% CI] 0.47 [0.23; 0.94]), a loss of mobility (aOR [95% CI] 0.30 [0.14; 0.63]), and a loss of ADL score (aOR [95% CI] 0.30 [0.14; 0.63]). On day 180, 52 (56%) COVID-19 patients presented signs of dyspnea, 37 (40%) still used analgesics, 17 (18%) used anxiolytics, and 14 (13%) used antidepressant. 

CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related ICU stay was not associated with a lower quality of life or lower autonomy compared to non-COVID-19-related ICU stay.

**摘要**

目的：比较因COVID-19导致的呼吸窘迫而在ICU住院的老年患者与非COVID-19相关原因导致的老年患者在自主性和生活质量方面的差异。设计：比较两项前瞻性多中心研究。设置：本研究基于2项前瞻性多中心研究，Senior-COVID-Rea队列（COVID-19诊断的ICU住院患者，年龄超过60岁）和FRAGIREA队列（ICU住院患者，年龄超过70岁）。患者：我们纳入了两个队列的患者，在入院后180天进行评价（ADL评分和生活质量）。干预：无。

测量和主要结果：共纳入93例COVID-19患者和185例对照ICU患者。两组在年龄、体重指数、机械通气、ICU住院时间以及ADL和SAPS II评分方面均不平衡。我们使用有序logistic回归对COVID-19对生活质量和ADL评分的影响进行建模。在对这些因素进行校正后，我们观察到COVID-19患者不太可能出现日常活动能力丧失(aOR[95%CI]0.47[0.23；0.94])、运动能力丧失(aOR[95%CI]0.30[0.14；0.63])和ADL评分丧失(aOR[95%CI]0.30[0.14；0.63])。第180天，52例(56%)COVID-19患者出现呼吸困难的体征，37例(40%)仍使用镇痛药，17例(18%)使用抗焦虑药，14例(13%)使用抗抑郁药。

结论：与非COVID-19相关ICU住院相比，COVID-19相关ICU住院与生活质量较低或自主性较低无关。

## The necessity of a loading dose when prescribing intravenous colistin in critically ill patients with CRGNB-associated pneumonia: a multi-center observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The importance or necessity of a loading dose when prescribing intravenous colistin has not been well established in clinical practice, and approximate one-third to half of patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) infection did not receive the administration of a loading dose. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and risk of acute kidney injury when prescribing intravenous colistin for critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by CRGNB. 

METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study that recruited ICU-admitted patients who had CRGNB-associated nosocomial pneumonia and were treated with intravenous colistin. Then, we classified the patients into colistin loading dose (N = 85) and nonloading dose groups (N = 127). After propensity-score matching for important covariates, we compared the mortality rate, clinical outcome and microbiological eradication rates between the groups (N = 67). 

RESULTS: The loading group had higher percentages of patients with favorable clinical outcomes (55.2% and 35.8%, p = 0.037) and microbiological eradication rates (50% and 27.3%, p = 0.042) at day 14 than the nonloading group. The mortality rates at days 7, 14 and 28 and overall in-hospital mortality were not different between the two groups, but the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the loading group had a longer survival time than the nonloading group. Furthermore, the loading group had a shorter length of hospital stay than the nonloading group (52 and 60, p = 0.037). Regarding nephrotoxicity, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing acute kidney injury between the groups. 

CONCLUSIONS: The administration of a loading dose is recommended when prescribing intravenous colistin for critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by CRGNB.

##中文标题- 在CRGNB相关肺炎重症患者中处方静脉内粘菌素时负荷剂量的必要性：一项多中心观察性研究

**摘要**

背景：临床实践中尚未充分确定处方静脉内粘菌素时负荷剂量的重要性或必要性，大约1/3至1/2的碳青霉烯类耐药革兰氏阴性菌(CRGNB)感染患者未接受负荷剂量给药。本研究的目的是调查为CRGNB引起的院内获得性肺炎的重症患者处方静脉注射粘菌素时的疗效和急性肾损伤的风险。

方法：这是一项多中心、回顾性研究，招募了ICU收治的CRGNB相关医院获得性肺炎患者，并接受静脉内粘菌素治疗。然后，我们将患者分类为粘菌素负荷剂量组(N = 85)和非负荷剂量组(N = 127)。在对重要协变量进行倾向评分匹配后，我们比较了两组之间的死亡率、临床结局和微生物学根除率(N = 67)。

结果：与非负荷组相比，负荷组第14天时临床结局有利的患者百分比（55.2%和35.8%，p = 0.037）和微生物清除率有利的患者百分比（50%和27.3%，p = 0.042）更高。两组第7、14和28天的死亡率和总体住院死亡率没有差异，但是Kaplan-Meier分析显示负荷剂量组比非负荷剂量组生存时间更长。此外，负荷剂量组的住院时间短于非负荷剂量组（52和60，p = 0.037）。关于肾毒性，治疗组之间发生急性肾损伤的风险没有显著差异。

结论：为CRGNB引起的医院内肺炎重症患者处方静脉注射粘菌素时，建议给予负荷剂量。

## Continuous renal replacement therapy versus intermittent hemodialysis as first modality for renal replacement therapy in severe acute kidney injury: a secondary analysis of AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU studies

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are the two main RRT modalities in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Meta-analyses conducted more than 10 years ago did not show survival difference between these two modalities. As the quality of RRT delivery has improved since then, we aimed to reassess whether the choice of IHD or CRRT as first modality affects survival of patients with severe AKI. 

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of two multicenter randomized controlled trials (AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU) that compared an early RRT initiation strategy with a delayed one. We included patients allocated to the early strategy in order to emulate a trial where patients would have been randomized to receive either IHD or CRRT within twelve hours after the documentation of severe AKI. We determined each patient's modality group as the first RRT modality they received. The primary outcome was 60-day overall survival. We used two propensity score methods to balance the differences in baseline characteristics between groups and the primary analysis relied on inverse probability of treatment weighting. 

RESULTS: A total of 543 patients were included. Continuous RRT was the first modality in 269 patients and IHD in 274. Patients receiving CRRT had higher cardiovascular and total-SOFA scores. Inverse probability weighting allowed to adequately balance groups on all predefined confounders. The weighted Kaplan-Meier death rate at day 60 was 54·4% in the CRRT group and 46·5% in the IHD group (weighted HR 1·26, 95% CI 1·01-1·60). In a complementary analysis of less severely ill patients (SOFA score: 3-10), receiving IHD was associated with better day 60 survival compared to CRRT (weighted HR 1.82, 95% CI 1·01-3·28; p < 0.01). We found no evidence of a survival difference between the two RRT modalities in more severe patients. 

CONCLUSION: Compared to IHD, CRRT as first modality seemed to convey no benefit in terms of survival or of kidney recovery and might even have been associated with less favorable outcome in patients with lesser severity of disease. A prospective randomized non-inferiority trial should be implemented to solve the persistent conundrum of the optimal RRT technique.

##中文标题- 连续性肾脏替代治疗与间歇性血液透析作为重度急性肾损伤患者肾脏替代治疗的第一模式：AKIKI和IDEAL-ICU研究的二次分析

**摘要**

背景：间歇性血液透析(IHD)和连续性肾脏替代治疗(CRRT)是重度急性肾损伤(AKI)患者中两种主要的RRT模式。10多年前进行的荟萃分析未显示这两种方式之间的生存差异。自那时起，随着RRT输送质量的改善，我们旨在重新评估选择IHD或CRRT作为第一模式是否会影响重度AKI患者的生存率。

方法：这是对比较早期RRT启动策略与延迟启动策略的两项多中心随机对照试验（AKIKI和IDEAL-ICU）的二次分析。我们纳入了分配至早期策略的患者，以模拟一项试验，其中患者将在证实重度AKI后12小时内随机接受IHD或CRRT。我们确定每名患者的模式组作为他们接受的第一种RRT模式。主要结局为60天总生存期。我们使用了两种倾向评分方法来平衡组间基线特征的差异，主要分析依赖于治疗加权的逆概率。

结果：共纳入543例患者。269例患者首先采用连续RRT，274例患者首先采用IHD。接受CRRT的患者的心血管和总SOFA评分较高。逆概率加权允许充分平衡所有预定义混杂因素的组。第60天加权Kaplan-Meier死亡率，CRRT组为54.4%，IHD组为46.5%（加权hr1.26，95%ci1.01-1·60）。在病情不太严重患者（SOFA评分：3-10）的补充分析中，与CRRT相比，接受IHD与更好的第60天生存率相关（加权HR 1.82，95%CI 1.03-3.28；p < 0.01）。我们未发现两种RRT模式在更严重患者中存在生存差异的证据。

结论：与IHD相比，CRRT作为第一方式似乎并未带来生存或肾脏恢复方面的获益，甚至可能与疾病严重程度较轻患者中的不利结局相关。应实施前瞻性随机非劣效性试验，以解决最佳RRT技术的难题。

## Predictors of response to intra-arterial vasodilatory therapy of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia in patients with severe shock: results from a prospective observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a life-threatening condition occurring in patients with shock and is characterized by vasoconstriction of the mesenteric arteries leading to intestinal ischemia and multi-organ failure. Although minimal invasive local intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators into the mesenteric circulation has been suggested as a therapeutic option in NOMI, current knowledge is based on retrospective case series and it remains unclear which patients might benefit. Here, we prospectively analyzed predictors of response to intra-arterial therapy in patients with NOMI. 

METHODS: This is a prospective single-center observational study to analyze improvement of ischemia (indicated by reduction of blood lactate > 2 mmol/l from baseline after 24 h, primary endpoint) and 28-day mortality (key secondary endpoint) in patients with NOMI undergoing intra-arterial vasodilatory therapy. Predictors of response to therapy concerning primary and key secondary endpoint were identified using a) clinical parameters as well as b) data from 2D-perfusion angiography and c) experimental biomarkers of intestinal injury. 

RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included into this study. At inclusion patients had severe shock, indicated by high doses of norepinephrine (NE) (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 0.37 (0.21-0.60) μg/kg/min), elevated lactate concentrations (9.2 (5.2-13) mmol/l) and multi-organ failure. Patients showed a continuous reduction of lactate following intra-arterial prostaglandin infusion (baseline: (9.2 (5.2-13) mmol/l vs. 24 h: 4.4 (2.5-9.1) mmol/l, p < 0.001) with 22 patients (52.4%) reaching a lactate reduction > 2 mmol/l at 24 h following intervention. Initial higher lactate concentrations and lower NE doses at baseline were independent predictors of an improvement of ischemia. 28-day mortality was 59% in patients with a reduction of lactate > 2 mmol/l 24 h after inclusion, while it was 85% in all other patients (hazard ratio 0.409; 95% CI, 0.14-0.631, p = 0.005). 

CONCLUSIONS: A reduction of lactate concentrations was observed following implementation of intra-arterial therapy, and lactate reduction was associated with better survival. Our findings concerning outcome predictors in NOMI patients undergoing intra-arterial prostaglandin therapy might help designing a randomized controlled trial to further investigate this therapeutic approach.

##中文标题- 重度休克患者对非闭塞性肠系膜缺血的动脉内血管扩张治疗反应的预测因素：一项前瞻性观察性研究的结果

**摘要**

背景：非闭塞性肠系膜缺血(NOMI)是发生在休克患者中的一种危及生命的疾病，其特征是肠系膜动脉血管收缩，导致肠缺血和多器官衰竭。尽管已表明微创局部动脉内输注血管扩张剂至肠系膜循环是NOMI的一种治疗选择，但目前的知识是基于回顾性病例系列研究，仍不清楚哪些患者可能获益。在此，我们前瞻性分析了NOMI患者动脉内治疗反应的预测因素。

方法：这是一项前瞻性单中心观察性研究，旨在分析接受动脉内血管扩张治疗的NOMI患者的缺血改善（表现为24h后血乳酸较基线降低 > 2 mmol/L，主要终点）和28天死亡率（关键次要终点）。使用a）临床参数以及b）来自2D灌注血管造影术的数据和c）肠损伤的实验生物标志物来识别主要和关键次要终点相关治疗应答的预测因子。

结果：本研究共纳入42例患者。入选时，患者出现重度休克，表现为高剂量去甲肾上腺素(NE)（中位数（四分位距(IQR)）0.37(0.21-0.60)μg/kg/min）、乳酸盐浓度升高(9.2(5.2-13)mmol/l)和多器官衰竭。动脉内前列腺素输注结束后，患者的乳酸盐水平持续下降（基线：9.2(5.2-13)mmol/l vs. 24 h：4.4(2.5-9.1)mmol/l，p<0.001），干预结束后24h，22名患者(52.4%)的乳酸盐水平下降幅度>2 mmol/L。基线时初始较高的乳酸盐浓度和较低的NE剂量是缺血改善的独立预测因素。入选后24h乳酸盐降低 > 2 mmol/L的患者中28天死亡率为59%，而所有其他患者中为85%（风险比0.409；95%CI，0.14-0.631，p = 0.005）。

结论：动脉内治疗后观察到乳酸盐浓度降低，乳酸盐降低与更好的生存率相关。我们关于接受动脉内前列腺素治疗的NOMI患者结局预测因子的结果可能有助于设计一项随机对照试验，以进一步研究这种治疗方法。

## Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese Intensive care PAtient Database

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Dopamine is used to treat patients with shock in intensive care units (ICU) throughout the world, despite recent evidence against its use. The aim of this study was to identify the latest practice of dopamine use in Japan and also to explore the consequences of dopamine use in a large Asian population. 

METHODS: The Japanese Intensive Care PAtient Database (JIPAD), the largest intensive care database in Japan, was utilized. Inclusion criteria included: 1) age 18 years or older, 2) admitted to the ICU for reasons other than procedures, 3) ICU length of stay of 24 h or more, and 4) treatment with either dopamine or noradrenaline within 24 h of admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable regression analysis was performed, followed by a propensity score-matched analysis. 

RESULTS: Of the 132,354 case records, 14,594 records from 56 facilities were included in this analysis. Dopamine was administered to 4,653 patients and noradrenaline to 11,844. There was no statistically significant difference in facility characteristics between frequent dopamine users (N = 28) and infrequent users (N = 28). Patients receiving dopamine had more cardiovascular diagnosis codes (70% vs. 42%; p < 0.01), more post-elective surgery status (60% vs. 31%), and lower APACHE III scores compared to patients given noradrenaline alone (70.7 vs. 83.0; p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed an odds ratio for in-hospital mortality of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.71-1.04] in the dopamine ≤ 5 μg/kg/min group, 1.46 [95% CI: 1.18-1.82] in the 5-15 μg/kg/min group, and 3.30 [95% CI: 1.19-9.19] in the > 15 μg/kg/min group. In a 1:1 propensity score matching for dopamine use as a vasopressor (570 pairs), both in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality were significantly higher in the dopamine group compared to no dopamine group (22.5% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.038; 13.3% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.018), as well as ICU length of stay (mean 9.3 days vs. 7.4 days, p = 0.004). 

CONCLUSION: Dopamine is still widely used in Japan. The results of this study suggest detrimental effects of dopamine use specifically at a high dose.

##中文标题- 重症监护室中多巴胺的使用及其后果：一项利用日本重症监护患者数据库的队列研究

**摘要**

背景：尽管近期有证据表明多巴胺不能用于治疗休克，但仍在全球重症监护室(ICU)使用。本研究的目的是确定日本多巴胺使用的最新实践，并探索在大量亚洲人群中使用多巴胺的后果。

方法：使用了日本最大的重症监护患者数据库(JIPAD)。入选标准包括：1）年龄≥18岁；2）因操作以外的原因入住ICU；3）ICU住院时间≥24h；4）入院24h内接受多巴胺或去甲肾上腺素治疗。主要结局为住院期间死亡率。进行了多变量回归分析，随后进行了倾向评分匹配分析。

结果：在132,354份病例记录中，来自56家机构的14,594份记录被纳入本分析。4,653例患者接受了多巴胺给药，11,844例患者接受了去甲肾上腺素给药。频繁多巴胺使用者(N = 28)和不频繁多巴胺使用者(N = 28)之间的机构特征无统计学显著性差异。与接受去甲肾上腺素单药的患者相比，接受多巴胺的患者的心血管诊断代码更多(70%vs. 42%；p < 0.01)，择期手术后状态更多(60%vs. 31%)，APACHE III评分更低(70.7 vs. 83.0；p < 0.01)。多变量分析显示多巴胺≤5 μg/kg/min组住院死亡率的比值比为0.86[95%CI：0.71-1.04]，5-15 μg/kg/min组为1.46[95%CI：1.18-1.82]，> 15 μg/kg/min组为3.30[95%CI：1.19-9.19]。在多巴胺用作血管加压药的1:1倾向评分匹配中（570对），多巴胺组的住院死亡率和ICU死亡率均显著高于无多巴胺组（22.5%对比17.4%，p = 0.038；13.3%对比8.8%，p = 0.018），ICU住院时间也显著延长（平均9.3天对比7.4天，p = 0.004).

结论：多巴胺在日本仍在广泛使用。本研究的结果表明，尤其是在高剂量下使用多巴胺的有害作用。

## Pain and sedation management and monitoring in pediatric intensive care units across Europe: an ESPNIC survey

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Management and monitoring of pain and sedation to reduce discomfort as well as side effects, such as over- and under-sedation, withdrawal syndrome and delirium, is an integral part of pediatric intensive care practice. However, the current state of management and monitoring of analgosedation across European pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) remains unknown. The aim of this survey was to describe current practices across European PICUs regarding the management and monitoring of pain and sedation. 

METHODS: An online survey was distributed among 357 European PICUs assessing demographic features, drug choices and dosing, as well as usage of instruments for monitoring pain and sedation. We also compared low- and high-volume PICUs practices. Responses were collected from January to April 2021. 

RESULTS: A total of 215 (60% response rate) PICUs from 27 European countries responded. Seventy-one percent of PICUs stated to use protocols for analgosedation management, more frequently in high-volume PICUs (77% vs 63%, p = 0.028). First-choice drug combination was an opioid with a benzodiazepine, namely fentanyl (51%) and midazolam (71%) being the preferred drugs. The starting doses differed between PICUs from 0.1 to 5 mcg/kg/h for fentanyl, and 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg/h for midazolam. Daily assessment and documentation for pain (81%) and sedation (87%) was reported by most of the PICUs, using the preferred validated FLACC scale (54%) and the COMFORT Behavioural scale (48%), respectively. Both analgesia and sedation were mainly monitored by nurses (92% and 84%, respectively). Eighty-six percent of the responding PICUs stated to use neuromuscular blocking agents in some scenarios. Monitoring of paralysed patients was preferably done by observation of vital signs with electronic devices support. 

CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides an overview of current analgosedation practices among European PICUs. Drugs of choice, dosing and assessment strategies were shown to differ widely. Further research and development of evidence-based guidelines for optimal drug dosing and analgosedation assessment are needed.

##中文标题- 欧洲儿科重症监护室的疼痛和镇静管理与监测：ESPNIC调查

**摘要**

背景：管理和监测疼痛和镇静，以减少不适以及副作用，如镇静过度和不足、戒断综合征和谵妄，是儿科重症监护实践不可或缺的一部分。然而，欧洲儿科重症监护室(PICU)的管理和监测现状仍然未知。本调查的目的是描述欧洲PICU关于疼痛和镇静管理和监测的当前实践。

方法：在357间欧洲PICU中进行了在线调查，评估人口统计学特征、药物选择和剂量，以及用于监测疼痛和镇静的工具使用。我们还比较了低容量和高容量PICU的实践。收集了2021年1月至4月的缓解情况。

结果：来自27个欧洲国家的总计215个（60%应答率）PICU应答。71%的PICU表示使用方案进行合并管理，高容量PICU更频繁(77%vs 63%，p = 0.028)。首选药物组合是阿片类药物与苯二氮卓类药物，即芬太尼(51%)和咪达唑仑(71%)是首选药物。PICU之间芬太尼的起始剂量不同，为0.1-5 μg/kg/h，咪达唑仑的起始剂量不同，为0.01-0.5 mg/kg/h。大部分PICU分别使用首选经验证的FLACC量表(54%)和COMFORT行为量表(48%)报告疼痛(81%)和镇静(87%)的每日评估和记录。镇痛和镇静主要由护士监测（分别为92%和84%）。86%的相应PICU表示在某些情况下使用神经肌肉阻滞剂。对瘫痪患者的监测最好是在电子设备支持下观察生命体征。

结论：本调查提供了欧洲PICU中当前合并实践的概述。药物选择、剂量和评估策略显示差异很大。需要进一步研究和开发循证指南，以优化药物给药和合并评估。

## Effects of different positive end-expiratory pressure titration strategies during prone positioning in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective interventional study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Prone positioning in combination with the application of low tidal volume and adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves survival in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the effects of PEEP on end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptp(exp)) during prone positioning require clarification. For this purpose, the effects of three different PEEP titration strategies on Ptp(exp), respiratory mechanics, mechanical power, gas exchange, and hemodynamics were evaluated comparing supine and prone positioning. 

METHODS: In forty consecutive patients with moderate to severe ARDS protective ventilation with PEEP titrated according to three different titration strategies was evaluated during supine and prone positioning: (A) ARDS Network recommendations (PEEP(ARDSNetwork)), (B) the lowest static elastance of the respiratory system (PEEP(Estat,RS)), and (C) targeting a positive Ptp(exp) (PEEP(Ptpexp)). The primary endpoint was to analyze whether Ptp(exp) differed significantly according to PEEP titration strategy during supine and prone positioning. 

RESULTS: Ptp(exp) increased progressively with prone positioning compared with supine positioning as well as with PEEP(Estat,RS) and PEEP(Ptpexp) compared with PEEP(ARDSNetwork) (positioning effect p < 0.001, PEEP strategy effect p < 0.001). PEEP was lower during prone positioning with PEEP(Estat,RS) and PEEP(Ptpexp) (positioning effect p < 0.001, PEEP strategy effect p < 0.001). During supine positioning, mechanical power increased progressively with PEEP(Estat,RS) and PEEP(Ptpexp) compared with PEEP(ARDSNetwork), and prone positioning attenuated this effect (positioning effect p < 0.001, PEEP strategy effect p < 0.001). Prone compared with supine positioning significantly improved oxygenation (positioning effect p < 0.001, PEEP strategy effect p < 0.001) while hemodynamics remained stable in both positions. 

CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning increased transpulmonary pressures while improving oxygenation and hemodynamics in patients with moderate to severe ARDS when PEEP was titrated according to the ARDS Network lower PEEP table. This PEEP titration strategy minimized parameters associated with ventilator-induced lung injury induction, such as transpulmonary driving pressure and mechanical power. We propose that a lower PEEP strategy (PEEP(ARDSNetwork)) in combination with prone positioning may be part of a lung protective ventilation strategy in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

##中文标题- 急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者俯卧位时不同呼气末正压滴定策略的前瞻性干预研究

**摘要**

背景：俯卧位联合应用低潮气量和足够的呼气末正压通气(PEEP)改善了中重度急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者的生存率。然而，需要澄清俯卧位时PEEP对呼气末跨肺压(Ptp(exp))的影响。为此，通过比较仰卧位和俯卧位，评估了三种不同PEEP滴定策略对Ptp(exp)、呼吸力学、机械功率、气体交换和血流动力学的影响。

方法：在连续40例中度至重度ARDS患者中，在仰卧位和俯卧位时，评估根据三种不同滴定策略滴定PEEP的保护性通气：(A)ARDS网络推荐(PEEP(ARDSNetwork))，(B)呼吸系统的最低静态弹性(PEEP(Estat，RS))，和(C)靶向阳性Ptp(exp)(PEEP(Ptpexp))。主要终点是分析仰卧位和俯卧位时，根据PEEP滴定策略，Ptp(exp)是否有显著差异。

结果：采用俯卧位时Ptp(exp)较仰卧位时逐渐增加，采用PEEP(Estat，RS)和PEEP(Ptpexp)时较PEEP(ARDSNetwork)时也逐渐增加（定位效应p < 0.001，PEEP策略效应p < 0.001）。采用PEEP(Estat，RS)和PEEP(Ptpexp)时，俯卧位时PEEP较低（定位效应p < 0.001，PEEP策略效应p < 0.001）。仰卧位时，与PEEP(ARDSNetwork)相比，PEEP(Estat，RS)和PEEP(Ptpexp)的机械功率逐渐增加，俯卧位减弱了这种效应（定位效应p < 0.001，PEEP策略效应p < 0.001）。与仰卧位相比，仰卧位显著改善了氧合（定位效应p < 0.001，PEEP策略效应p < 0.001），而两种体位的血液动力学均保持稳定。

结论：根据ARDS网络下限PEEP表进行PEEP滴定时，俯卧位增加中至重度ARDS患者的跨肺压，同时改善氧合和血流动力学。这种PEEP滴定策略可最大限度地减少与呼吸机诱导的肺损伤诱导相关的参数，如跨肺驱动压力和机械功率。我们提出，较低的PEEP策略(PEEP(ARDSNetwork))结合俯卧位可能是中重度ARDS患者肺保护通气策略的一部分。

## Factors for success of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: analysis of a randomized controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning (APP) improves oxygenation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and, when successful, may decrease the risk of intubation. However, factors associated with APP success remain unknown. In this secondary analysis, we aimed to assess whether APP can reduce intubation rate in patients with COVID-19 and to focus on the factors associated with success. 

METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, conducted in three high-acuity units, we randomly assigned patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen to APP or standard care. Primary outcome was intubation rate at 28 days. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictors associated to treatment success (survival without intubation). 

RESULTS: Among 430 patients randomized, 216 were assigned to APP and 214 to standard care. The APP group had a lower intubation rate (30% vs 43%, relative risk [RR] 0.70; CI(95) 0.54-0.90, P = 0.006) and shorter hospital length of stay (11 interquartile range [IQR, 9-14] vs 13 [IQR, 10-17] days, P = 0.001). A respiratory rate ≤ 25 bpm at enrollment, an increase in ROX index > 1.25 after first APP session, APP duration > 8 h/day, and a decrease in lung ultrasound score ≥ 2 within the first 3 days were significantly associated with treatment success for APP. 

CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19-induced AHRF treated by HFNC, APP reduced intubation rate and improved treatment success. A longer APP duration is associated with APP success, while the increase in ROX index and decrease in lung ultrasound score after APP can also help identify patients most likely to benefit.

##中文标题- COVID-19诱导的急性低氧性呼吸衰竭患者中，清醒俯卧位成功的因素：一项随机对照试验的分析

**摘要**

背景：清醒俯卧位(APP)可改善冠状病毒病(COVID-19)患者的氧合，成功时可降低插管风险。但是，与APP成功相关的因素仍然未知。在该次要分析中，我们旨在评估APP是否能降低COVID-19患者的插管率，并重点关注与成功相关的因素。

方法：在3个高敏度病房进行的多中心随机对照试验中，我们将需要高流量鼻插管(HFNC)吸氧的COVID-19诱导的急性低氧性呼吸衰竭(AHRF)患者随机分配至APP组或标准治疗组。主要结局为28天时的插管率。进行了多变量分析，以确定与治疗成功相关的预测因素（无插管生存）。

结果：在430例随机化患者中，216例被分配至APP组，214例被分配至标准治疗组。APP组的插管率较低（30%vs 43%，相对风险[RR]0.70；CI(95)0.54-0.90，P = 0.006），住院时间较短（11个四分位距[IQR，9-14]vs 13[IQR，10-17]天，P = 0.001）。入组时呼吸率≤25 bpm、首次APP治疗后ROX指数升高 > 1.25、APP持续时间 > 8 h/天、前3天内肺部超声评分降低≥2与APP的治疗成功显著相关。

结论：在接受HFNC治疗的COVID-19诱导的AHRF患者中，APP降低了插管率，提高了治疗成功率。较长的APP持续时间与APP成功相关，而APP后ROX指数的增加和肺部超声评分的降低也可以帮助识别最有可能获益的患者。

## Intracranial hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory failure: a nationwide register study report

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). During ECMO therapy, anticoagulation is crucial to prevent device-associated thrombosis and device failure, however, it is associated with bleeding complications. In COVID-19, additional pathologies, such as endotheliitis, may further increase the risk of bleeding complications. To assess the frequency of bleeding events, we analyzed data from the German COVID-19 autopsy registry (DeRegCOVID). 

METHODS: The electronic registry uses a web-based electronic case report form. In November 2021, the registry included N = 1129 confirmed COVID-19 autopsy cases, with data on 63 ECMO autopsy cases and 1066 non-ECMO autopsy cases, contributed from 29 German sites. FINDINGS: The registry data showed that ECMO was used in younger male patients and bleeding events occurred much more frequently in ECMO cases compared to non-ECMO cases (56% and 9%, respectively). Similarly, intracranial bleeding (ICB) was documented in 21% of ECMO cases and 3% of non-ECMO cases and was classified as the immediate or underlying cause of death in 78% of ECMO cases and 37% of non-ECMO cases. In ECMO cases, the three most common immediate causes of death were multi-organ failure, ARDS and ICB, and in non-ECMO cases ARDS, multi-organ failure and pulmonary bacterial ± fungal superinfection, ordered by descending frequency. INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests the potential value of autopsies and a joint interdisciplinary multicenter (national) approach in addressing fatal complications in COVID-19.

##中文标题- COVID-19患者急性呼吸衰竭体外膜肺氧合期间颅内出血：全国注册研究报告

**摘要**

背景：在重度病例中，SARS-CoV-2感染导致急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)，通常通过体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)进行治疗。ECMO治疗期间，抗凝对于预防装置相关血栓形成和装置故障至关重要，然而，抗凝则会引起出血并发症。在COVID-19中，其他病理学，如，内皮炎，可能会进一步增加出血并发症的风险。为了评估出血事件的频率，我们分析了来自德国COVID-19尸检登记研究(DeRegCOVID)的数据。

方法：电子登记使用基于网络的电子病例报告表。2021年11月，登记数据库包括N = 1129例确认的COVID-19尸检病例，来自29个德国研究中心的63例ECMO尸检病例和1066例非ECMO尸检病例的数据。结果：登记数据显示，在年轻男性患者中使用ECMO，与非ECMO病例相比，ECMO病例中出血事件的发生率更高（分别为56%和9%）。同样，21%的ECMO病例和3%的非ECMO病例记录到颅内出血(ICB)，78%的ECMO病例和37%的非ECMO病例归类为直接或潜在死亡原因。在ECMO病例中，三种最常见的直接死亡原因为多器官衰竭、ARDS和ICB，在非ECMO病例中，ARDS、多器官衰竭和肺部细菌±真菌双重感染按发生频率降序排列。解释：我们的研究表明，尸检和联合跨学科多中心（国家）方法在COVID-19中解决致死性并发症的潜在价值。

## Early prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19: a propensity score analysis from the multicentric cohort COVID-ICU network-the ProneCOVID study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Delaying time to prone positioning (PP) may be associated with higher mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We evaluated the use and the impact of early PP on clinical outcomes in intubated patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19. 

METHODS: All intubated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 were involved in a secondary analysis from a prospective multicenter cohort study of COVID-ICU network including 149 ICUs across France, Belgium and Switzerland. Patients were followed-up until Day-90. The primary outcome was survival at Day-60. Analysis used a Cox proportional hazard model including a propensity score. 

RESULTS: Among 2137 intubated patients, 1504 (70.4%) were placed in PP during their ICU stay and 491 (23%) during the first 24 h following ICU admission. One hundred and eighty-one patients (36.9%) of the early PP group had a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio > 150 mmHg when prone positioning was initiated. Among non-early PP group patients, 1013 (47.4%) patients had finally been placed in PP within a median delay of 3 days after ICU admission. Day-60 mortality in non-early PP group was 34.2% versus 39.3% in the early PP group (p = 0.038). Day-28 and Day-90 mortality as well as the need for adjunctive therapies was more important in patients with early PP. After propensity score adjustment, no significant difference in survival at Day-60 was found between the two study groups (HR 1.34 [0.96-1.68], p = 0.09 and HR 1.19 [0.998-1.412], p = 0.053 in complete case analysis or in multiple imputation analysis, respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicentric international cohort of intubated ICU patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, PP has been used frequently as a main treatment. In this study, our data failed to show a survival benefit associated with early PP started within 24 h after ICU admission compared to PP after day-1 for all COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation regardless of their severity.

##中文标题- 与COVID-19相关的急性呼吸窘迫综合征的早期俯卧位：多中心队列COVID-ICU网络的倾向评分分析—ProneCOVID研究

**摘要**

背景：延迟俯卧位(PP)的时间可能与2019年冠状病毒病导致的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)的死亡率较高相关(COVID-19)。我们评估了COVID-19中重症监护室(ICU)住院的插管患者中早期PP的使用和对临床结局的影响。

方法：COVID-ICU网络的前瞻性多中心队列研究（包括法国、比利时和瑞士的149个ICU）的二次分析涉及所有因COVID-19导致的插管患者。对患者随访至第90天。主要结局为第60天的生存率。分析使用Cox比例风险模型，包括倾向评分。

结果：在2137例插管患者中，1504例(70.4%)在ICU住院期间置入PP，491例(23%)在ICU住院后前24h置入PP。在开始俯卧位时，早期PP组181例患者(36.9%)的PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值 > 150 mmHg。在非早期PP组患者中，1013例(47.4%)患者在进入ICU后中位延迟3天内最终进入PP。非早期PP组的第60天死亡率为34.2%，而早期PP组为39.3%(p = 0.038)。在早期PP患者中，第28天和第90天死亡率以及辅助治疗的需求更重要。调整倾向评分后，两个研究组之间第-60天的生存率无显著差异（在完整病例分析或多重插补分析中分别为HR 1.34[0.96-1.68]，p = 0.09和HR 1.19[0.998-1.412]，p = 0.053）。

结论：在一个由COVID-19导致的插管ICU患者的大型多中心国际队列中，PP经常作为主要治疗。在本研究中，我们的数据未能显示，对于所有需要有创机械通气的COVID-19患者，无论其严重程度如何，与第-1天后的PP相比，早期PP在ICU入院后24h内开始的生存获益。

## Nasal pressure swings as the measure of inspiratory effort in spontaneously breathing patients with de novo acute respiratory failure

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Excessive inspiratory effort could translate into self-inflicted lung injury, thus worsening clinical outcomes of spontaneously breathing patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Although esophageal manometry is a reliable method to estimate the magnitude of inspiratory effort, procedural issues significantly limit its use in daily clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe the correlation between esophageal pressure swings (ΔP(es)) and nasal (ΔP(nos)) as a potential measure of inspiratory effort in spontaneously breathing patients with de novo ARF. 

METHODS: From January 1, 2021, to September 1, 2021, 61 consecutive patients with ARF (83.6% related to COVID-19) admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy) and candidate to escalation of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) were enrolled. Clinical features and tidal changes in esophageal and nasal pressure were recorded on admission and 24 h after starting NRS. Correlation between ΔP(es) and ΔP(nos) served as primary outcome. The effect of ΔP(nos) measurements on respiratory rate and ΔP(es) was also assessed. 

RESULTS: ΔP(es) and ΔP(nos) were strongly correlated at admission (R(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) and 24 h apart (R(2) = 0.94, p < 0.001). The nasal plug insertion and the mouth closure required for ΔP(nos) measurement did not result in significant change of respiratory rate and ΔP(es). The correlation between measures at 24 h remained significant even after splitting the study population according to the type of NRS (high-flow nasal cannulas [R(2) = 0.79, p < 0.001] or non-invasive ventilation [R(2) = 0.95, p < 0.001]). 

CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with ARF, nasal pressure swings did not alter respiratory mechanics in the short term and were highly correlated with esophageal pressure swings during spontaneous tidal breathing. ΔP(nos) might warrant further investigation as a measure of inspiratory effort in patients with ARF.

##中文标题- 在新发急性呼吸衰竭的自主呼吸患者中，鼻压力波动作为吸气努力的测量指标

**摘要**

背景：过度吸气可能转化为自我造成的肺损伤，从而恶化急性呼吸衰竭(ARF)自主呼吸患者的临床结局。虽然食管测压是估计吸气努力程度的可靠方法，但程序问题显著限制了其在日常临床实践中的使用。本研究旨在描述食管压力波动(ΔP(es))与鼻(ΔP(nos))之间的相关性，作为初发ARF患者自主呼吸中吸气努力的潜在指标。

方法：从2021年1月1日至2021年9月1日，连续61例ARF患者（83.6%与COVID-19相关）进入摩德纳大学医院（意大利）的呼吸重症监护室(RICU)，并作为无创呼吸支持(NRS)升级的候选者。记录入院时和开始NRS后24 h的临床特征以及食管和鼻腔压力的潮气量变化。将ΔP(es)和ΔP(nos)之间的相关性作为主要结局。还评估了ΔP(nos)测量对呼吸频率和ΔP(es)的影响。

结果：ΔP(es)和ΔP(nos)在入院时(R(2)= 0.88，P < 0.001)和间隔24h(R(2)= 0.94，P < 0.001)强烈相关。ΔP(nos)测量所需的鼻塞插入和口腔闭合未导致呼吸频率和ΔP(es)的显著变化。按照NRS类型（高流量鼻导管[R(2)= 0.79，p < 0.001]或无创通气[R(2)= 0.95，p < 0.001]）将研究人群分开后，24h测量值之间的相关性仍然显著。

结论：在一个ARF患者队列中，鼻压力波动不会在短期内改变呼吸力学，与自主潮式呼吸期间的食管压力波动高度相关。ΔP(nos)可能需要进一步研究，作为ARF患者的吸气努力指标。

## The impact of acquired coagulation factor XIII deficiency in traumatic bleeding and wound healing

**Abstract**

Factor XIII (FXIII) is a protein involved in blood clot stabilisation which also plays an important role in processes including trauma, wound healing, tissue repair, pregnancy, and even bone metabolism. Following surgery, low FXIII levels have been observed in patients with peri-operative blood loss and FXIII administration in those patients was associated with reduced blood transfusions. Furthermore, in patients with low FXIII levels, FXIII supplementation reduced the incidence of post-operative complications including disturbed wound healing. Increasing awareness of potentially low FXIII levels in specific patient populations could help identify patients with acquired FXIII deficiency; although opinions and protocols vary, a cut-off for FXIII activity of ~ 60-70% may be appropriate to diagnose acquired FXIII deficiency and guide supplementation. This narrative review discusses altered FXIII levels in trauma, surgery and wound healing, diagnostic approaches to detect FXIII deficiency and clinical guidance for the treatment of acquired FXIII deficiency.

##中文标题- 获得性凝血因子XIII缺乏对创伤性出血和伤口愈合的影响

**摘要**

因子XIII(FXIII)是一种参与血凝块稳定的蛋白质，在创伤、伤口愈合、组织修复、妊娠甚至骨代谢等过程中也发挥重要作用。术后，在围手术期失血患者中观察到FXIII水平较低，这些患者接受FXIII给药与输血减少有关。此外，在FXIII水平较低的患者中，补充FXIII降低了术后并发症的发生率，包括干扰伤口愈合。提高对特定患者人群中FXIII潜在低水平的认识可能有助于识别获得性FXIII缺乏患者；尽管意见和方案各不相同，但FXIII活性的临界值约为60-70%可能适合诊断获得性FXIII缺乏并指导补充治疗。本叙述性综述讨论了创伤、手术和伤口愈合中的FXIII水平改变、检测FXIII缺乏的诊断方法和获得性FXIII缺乏治疗的临床指导。

## The pathogens of secondary infection in septic patients share a similar genotype to those that predominate in the gut

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Secondary nosocomial infections, which are commonly caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), often develop in septic patients. This study aimed to identify the origin of secondary systemic pathogens and reveal the underlying mechanism of infection. 

METHODS: In this prospective, observational case-control study, a total of 34 septic patients, 33 non-septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 10 healthy individuals serving as controls were enrolled. Three hundred and twelve fecal samples were collected and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Metagenome sequencing was performed to identify the homology between dominant CRKP or VRE in the intestine and pathogens isolated from secondary infectious sites. C57/BL mice were established as pseudo germ-free animal model by pretreatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for two weeks. 

RESULTS: The abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota in septic patients was drastically decreased one week after ICU admission, potentially leading to the enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as CRKP. Furthermore, secondary bloodstream and abdominal infections caused by CRKP or VRE in septic patients occurred after intestinal colonization with the predominant bacterial species. Genomic analysis showed that bacteria isolated from secondary infection had high homology with the corresponding predominant intestinal opportunistic pathogens. In addition, animal model experiments validated the hypothesis that the administration of antibiotics caused the enrichment of CRKP and VRE among the intestinal microbiota, increasing the likelihood of permeation of other tissues and potentially causing subsequent systemic infection in pseudo germ-free mice. 

CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the pathogens causing secondary infection in septic patients might originate from the intestinal colonization of pathogens following broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.

##中文标题- 脓毒症患者继发感染的病原体与肠道内占优势的病原体具有相似的基因型

**摘要**

背景：继发医院感染，通常由碳青霉烯类耐药的肺炎克雷伯菌(CRKP)和万古霉素耐药的屎肠球菌(VRE)引起，通常发生在败血症患者中。本研究旨在确定继发性全身病原体的来源，并揭示感染的潜在机制。

方法：在这项前瞻性、观察性病例对照研究中，共纳入34例脓毒症患者、33例非脓毒症重症监护室(ICU)患者和10例作为对照的健康个体。采集312份粪便样本，进行16srrna基因扩增子测序。进行宏基因组测序，鉴定肠道显性CRKP或VRE与从继发感染部位分离的病原体之间的同源性。用广谱抗生素预处理C57/BL小鼠2周，建立假无菌动物模型。

结果：入住ICU一周后，脓毒症患者肠道菌群的丰度和多样性急剧下降，可能导致抗生素耐药菌的富集，如CRKP。此外，败血症患者中CRKP或VRE引起的继发性血液和腹部感染发生在主要细菌物种的肠道定植之后。基因组分析显示，继发感染分离的细菌与相应的优势肠道机会致病菌具有高度同源性。此外，动物模型实验验证了以下假设：在假无菌小鼠中，抗生素给药导致CRKP和VRE在肠道菌群中富集，增加了其他组织渗透的可能性，并可能引起随后的全身性感染。

结论：我们的研究表明引起败血症患者继发感染的病原菌可能来源于广谱抗生素治疗后病原菌的肠道定植。

## Personalization of renal replacement therapy initiation: a secondary analysis of the AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU trials

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Trials comparing early and delayed strategies of renal replacement therapy in patients with severe acute kidney injury may have missed differences in survival as a result of mixing together patients at heterogeneous levels of risks. Our aim was to evaluate the heterogeneity of treatment effect on 60-day mortality from an early vs a delayed strategy across levels of risk for renal replacement therapy initiation under a delayed strategy. 

METHODS: We used data from the AKIKI, and IDEAL-ICU randomized controlled trials to develop a multivariable logistic regression model for renal replacement therapy initiation within 48 h after allocation to a delayed strategy. We then used an interaction with spline terms in a Cox model to estimate treatment effects across the predicted risks of RRT initiation. 

RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1107 patients (619 and 488 in the AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU trial respectively). In the pooled sample, we found evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects (P = 0.023). Patients at an intermediate-high risk of renal replacement therapy initiation within 48 h may have benefited from an early strategy (absolute risk difference,  - 14%; 95% confidence interval, - 27% to - 1%). For other patients, we found no evidence of benefit from an early strategy of renal replacement therapy initiation but a trend for harm (absolute risk difference, 8%; 95% confidence interval, - 5% to 21% in patients at intermediate-low risk). 

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a clinically sound heterogeneity of treatment effect of an early vs a delayed strategy of renal replacement therapy initiation that may reflect varying degrees of kidney demand-capacity mismatch.

##中文标题- 肾脏替代治疗启动的个性化：AKIKI和IDEAL-ICU试验的次要分析

**摘要**

背景：在重度急性肾损伤患者中比较早期和延迟肾脏替代治疗策略的试验可能遗漏了由于将患者以不同风险水平混合在一起导致的生存率差异。我们的目的是在延迟策略的肾脏替代治疗启动风险水平下，评估早期与延迟策略对60天死亡率的治疗效应的异质性。

方法：我们使用了ikaki和IDEAL-ICU随机对照试验的数据，为分配至延迟策略后48h内开始肾脏替代治疗开发了多变量logistic回归模型。然后，我们在Cox模型中使用样条项相互作用估计RRT启动预测风险中的治疗效应。

结果：我们分析了1107例患者的数据（AKIKI和IDEAL-ICU试验分别是619例和488例）。在汇总样本中，我们发现异质性治疗效应的证据(P = 0.023)。在48h内开始肾脏替代治疗的中-高危患者可能从早期策略中获益（绝对风险差异，  -14%；95%置信区间，-27%至-1%）。对于其他患者，我们未发现肾脏替代治疗早期策略获益的证据，但发现了危害趋势（绝对风险差异，8%；95%置信区间，-中-低风险患者为5%至21%）。

结论：我们已经确定了肾脏替代治疗早期与延迟策略的治疗效果的临床合理异质性，这可能反映了不同程度的肾脏需求-容量不匹配。

## Digital PCR applications for the diagnosis and management of infection in critical care medicine

**Abstract**

Infection (either community acquired or nosocomial) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critical care medicine. Sepsis is present in up to 30% of all ICU patients. A large fraction of sepsis cases is driven by severe community acquired pneumonia (sCAP), which incidence has dramatically increased during COVID-19 pandemics. A frequent complication of ICU patients is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), which affects 10-25% of all ventilated patients, and bloodstream infections (BSIs), affecting about 10% of patients. Management of these severe infections poses several challenges, including early diagnosis, severity stratification, prognosis assessment or treatment guidance. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a next-generation PCR method that offers a number of technical advantages to face these challenges: it is less affected than real time PCR by the presence of PCR inhibitors leading to higher sensitivity. In addition, dPCR offers high reproducibility, and provides absolute quantification without the need for a standard curve. In this article we reviewed the existing evidence on the applications of dPCR to the management of infection in critical care medicine. We included thirty-two articles involving critically ill patients. Twenty-three articles focused on the amplification of microbial genes: (1) four articles approached bacterial identification in blood or plasma; (2) one article used dPCR for fungal identification in blood; (3) another article focused on bacterial and fungal identification in other clinical samples; (4) three articles used dPCR for viral identification; (5) twelve articles quantified microbial burden by dPCR to assess severity, prognosis and treatment guidance; (6) two articles used dPCR to determine microbial ecology in ICU patients. The remaining nine articles used dPCR to profile host responses to infection, two of them for severity stratification in sepsis, four focused to improve diagnosis of this disease, one for detecting sCAP, one for detecting VAP, and finally one aimed to predict progression of COVID-19. This review evidences the potential of dPCR as a useful tool that could contribute to improve the detection and clinical management of infection in critical care medicine.

##中文标题- 数字PCR在重症医学感染诊断与管理中的应用

**摘要**

感染（社区获得性或院内获得性）是重症医学中发病和死亡的主要原因。高达30%的ICU患者存在败血症。很大一部分败血症病例是由重度社区获得性肺炎(sCAP)驱动的，在COVID-19大流行期间，sCAP的发病率急剧升高。ICU患者常见的并发症为呼吸机相关性肺炎(VAP)，累及所有通气患者的10-25%，血液感染(BSIs)，累及约10%的患者。这些严重感染的管理提出了几个挑战，包括早期诊断、严重程度分层、预后评估或治疗指导。数字PCR(dPCR)是新一代PCR方法，面临这些挑战具有许多技术优势：与实时PCR相比，它受PCR抑制剂的影响较小，导致灵敏度更高。此外，dPCR具有高重现性，无需标准曲线即可提供绝对定量。本文综述了dPCR在重症医学感染管理中应用的现有证据。我们纳入了32篇涉及重症患者的文章。其中23篇文献侧重于微生物基因的扩增：(1)4篇文献接近血液或血浆中的细菌鉴定；(2)1篇文献使用dPCR进行血液中的真菌鉴定；(3)另1篇文献侧重于其他临床样本中的细菌和真菌鉴定；(4)3篇文献采用dPCR进行病毒鉴定；(5)12篇文献采用dPCR定量微生物负荷，评估严重程度、预后及治疗指导；(6)2篇文献采用dPCR测定ICU患者微生物生态。其余9篇文章使用dPCR来描述宿主对感染的反应，其中2篇用于败血症的严重程度分层，4篇集中于改善这种疾病的诊断，1篇用于检测sCAP，1篇用于检测VAP，最后1篇旨在预测COVID-19的进展。本综述证实了dPCR作为一种有用的工具的潜力，可有助于改善重症医学中感染的检测和临床管理。

## Ischemic injury of the upper gastrointestinal tract after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a prospective, multicenter study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The consequences of cardiac arrest (CA) on the gastro-intestinal tract are poorly understood. We measured the incidence of ischemic injury in the upper gastro-intestinal tract after Out-of-hospital CA (OHCA) and determined the risk factors for and consequences of gastrointestinal ischemic injury according to its severity. 

METHODS: Prospective, non-controlled, multicenter study in nine ICUs in France and Belgium conducted from November 1, 2014 to November 30, 2018. Included patients underwent an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy 2 to 4 d after OHCA if still intubated and the presence of ischemic lesions of the upper gastro-intestinal tract was determined by a gastroenterologist. Lesions were a priori defined as severe if there was ulceration or necrosis and moderate if there was mucosal edema or erythema. We compared clinical and cardiac arrest characteristics of three groups of patients (no, moderate, and severe lesions) and identified variables associated with gastrointestinal ischemic injury using multivariate regression analysis. We also compared the outcomes (organ failure during ICU stay and neurological status at hospital discharge) of the three groups of patients. 

RESULTS: Among the 214 patients included in the analysis, 121 (57%, 95% CI 50-63%) had an upper gastrointestinal ischemic lesion, most frequently on the fundus. Ischemic lesions were severe in 55/121 (45%) patients. In multivariate regression, higher adrenaline dose during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR 1.25 per mg (1.08-1.46)) was independently associated with increased odds of severe upper gastrointestinal ischemic lesions; previous proton pump inhibitor use (OR 0.40 (0.14-1.00)) and serum bicarbonate on day 1 (OR 0.89 (0.81-0.97)) were associated with lower odds of ischemic lesions. Patients with severe lesions had a higher SOFA score during the ICU stay and worse neurological outcome at hospital discharge. 

CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients successfully resuscitated from OHCA had upper gastrointestinal tract ischemic injury. Presence of ischemic lesions was independently associated with the amount of adrenaline used during resuscitation. Patients with severe lesions had higher organ failure scores during the ICU stay and a worse prognosis.

##中文标题- 院外心脏骤停后上消化道缺血性损伤的前瞻性多中心研究

**摘要**

背景：心脏骤停(CA)对胃肠道的影响知之甚少。我们测量了院外CA(OHCA)后上消化道缺血性损伤的发生率，并根据其严重程度确定了胃肠道缺血性损伤的风险因素和后果。

方法：前瞻性、非对照、多中心研究，于2014年11月1日至2018年11月30日在法国和比利时的9家ICU进行。纳入的患者在OHCA后2-4天接受食管-胃-十二指肠镜检查，如果仍插管，则由胃肠病学家确定是否存在上消化道缺血性病变。先前将病变定义为如果存在溃疡或坏死则为重度，如果存在粘膜水肿或红斑则为中度。我们比较了三组患者（无、中度和重度病变）的临床和心脏骤停特征，并使用多变量回归分析确定了与胃肠道缺血性损伤相关的变量。我们还比较了3组患者的结局（ICU住院期间的器官衰竭和出院时的神经功能状态）。

结果：在纳入分析的214例患者中，121例(57%，95%CI 50-63%)有上消化道缺血性病变，最常见于胃底。55/121(45%)例患者的缺血性病变为重度。在多变量回归中，心肺复苏期间较高的肾上腺素剂量(OR 1.25/mg(1.08-1.46))与重度上消化道缺血性病变的几率增加独立相关；既往使用质子泵抑制剂(OR 0.40(0.14-1.00))和第1天血清碳酸氢盐(OR 0.89(0.81-0.97))与缺血性病变的几率较低相关。病变严重的患者在ICU住院期间SOFA评分更高，出院时神经系统结局更差。

结论：超过一半的OHCA患者成功复苏为上消化道缺血性损伤。缺血性病变的出现与复苏期间肾上腺素的用量独立相关。病变严重的患者在住ICU期间器官功能衰竭评分较高，预后较差。

## Drug dosing in hospitalized obese patients with COVID-19

**Abstract**

Obesity is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients admitted with COVID-19. Evidence based guidelines are available for COVID-19-related therapies but dosing information specific to patients with obesity is lacking. Failure to account for the pharmacokinetic alterations that exist in this population can lead to underdosing, and treatment failure, or overdosing, resulting in an adverse effect. The objective of this manuscript is to provide clinicians with guidance for making dosing decisions for medications used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A detailed literature search was conducted for medications listed in evidence-based guidelines from the National Institutes of Health with an emphasis on pharmacokinetics, dosing and obesity. Retrieved manuscripts were evaluated and the following prioritization strategy was used to form the decision framework for recommendations: clinical outcome data > pharmacokinetic studies > adverse effects > physicochemical properties. Most randomized controlled studies included a substantial number of patients who were obese but few had large numbers of patients more extreme forms of obesity. Pharmacokinetic data have described alterations with volume of distribution and clearance but this variability does not appear to warrant dosing modifications. Future studies should provide more information on size descriptors and stratification of data according to obesity and body habitus.

##中文标题- COVID-19住院肥胖患者的药物剂量

**摘要**

肥胖在COVID-19住院患者中非常普遍。COVID-19相关治疗可获得循证指南，但缺乏肥胖患者的特定剂量信息。未能解释该人群中存在的药代动力学变化可导致剂量不足、治疗失败或用药过量，从而导致不良反应。本手稿的目的是为临床医生提供在COVID-19患者治疗中所用药物的剂量决策指南。对美国国立卫生研究院循证指南中收载的药物进行了详细的文献检索，重点关注药代动力学、剂量和肥胖。对检索到的手稿进行评价，并采用以下优先策略形成建议的决策框架：临床结局数据 > 药代动力学研究 > 不良反应 > 理化特性。大多数随机对照研究纳入了大量肥胖患者，但很少有患者有更极端形式的肥胖。药代动力学数据已经描述了分布容积和清除率的变化，但是这种变异性似乎不需要调整剂量。未来的研究应该提供更多关于尺寸描述和根据肥胖和体型分层数据的信息。

## Target temperature management following cardiac arrest: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Temperature control with target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest has been endorsed by expert societies and adopted in international clinical practice guidelines but recent evidence challenges the use of hypothermic TTM. 

METHODS: Systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of clinical trials on adult survivors from cardiac arrest undergoing TTM for at least 12 h comparing TTM versus no TTM or with a separation > 2 °C between intervention and control groups using the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL databases from inception to 1 September 2021 (PROSPERO CRD42021248140). All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were considered. The risk ratio and 95% confidence interval for death (primary outcome) and unfavourable neurological recovery (secondary outcome) were captured using the original study definitions censored up to 180 days after cardiac arrest. Bias was assessed using the updated Cochrane risk-of-bias for randomised trials tool and certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. A hierarchical robust Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis was performed using both minimally informative and data-driven priors and reported by mean risk ratio (RR) and its 95% credible interval (95% CrI). 

RESULTS: In seven studies (three low bias, three intermediate bias, one high bias, very low to low certainty) recruiting 3792 patients the RR by TTM 32-34 °C was 0.95 [95% CrI 0.78-1.09] for death and RR 0.93 [95% CrI 0.84-1.02] for unfavourable neurological outcome. The posterior probability for no benefit (RR ≥ 1) by TTM 32-34 °C was 24% for death and 12% for unfavourable neurological outcome. The posterior probabilities for favourable treatment effects of TTM 32-34 °C were the highest for an absolute risk reduction of 2-4% for death (28-53% chance) and unfavourable neurological outcome (63-78% chance). Excluding four studies without active avoidance of fever in the control arm reduced the probability to achieve an absolute risk reduction > 2% for death or unfavourable neurological outcome to ≤ 50%. 

CONCLUSIONS: The posterior probability distributions did not support the use of TTM at 32-34 °C compared to 36 °C also including active control of fever to reduce the risk of death and unfavourable neurological outcome at 90-180 days. Any likely benefit of hypothermic TTM is smaller than targeted in RCTs to date.

**摘要**

背景：心脏骤停后目标温度管理(TTM)的温度控制已得到专家协会的认可并被国际临床实践指南采纳，但最近的证据对低温TTM的使用提出了挑战。

方法：使用PubMed/MEDLINE、EMBASE、从开始到2021年9月1日的CENTRAL数据库(PROSPERO CRD42021248140)。考虑了所有随机化和半随机化对照试验。采用心脏骤停后删失长达180天的原始研究定义，采集了死亡（主要结局）和不利神经学恢复（次要结局）的风险比和95%置信区间。使用随机化试验的更新Cochrane偏倚风险评估工具评估偏倚，使用推荐评估、开发和评价方法分级评估证据的确定性。使用信息量最小和数据驱动的先验值进行分层稳健贝叶斯模型平均荟萃分析，通过平均风险比(RR)及其95%置信区间(95%CrI)进行报告。

结果：在纳入3792例患者的7项研究（3项低偏倚，3项中等偏倚，1项高偏倚，极低至低确定性）中，TTM 32-34 °C测量的死亡RR为0.95[95%CrI 0.78-1.09]，不利神经学结局RR为0.93[95%CrI 0.84-1.02]。TTM 32-34 °C组的无获益(RR≥1)的后验概率为：死亡为24%，不利神经学结局为12%。TTM 32-34 °C的有利治疗效应的后验概率最高，死亡（机会28-53%）和不利神经学结局（机会63-78%）的绝对风险降低2-4%。排除对照组中未主动避免发热的4项研究，将死亡或不利神经学结局的绝对风险降低 > 2%至≤50%的概率。

结论：后验概率分布不支持使用TTM（32-34 °C对比36 °C），还包括积极控制发热以降低90-180天的死亡风险和不利的神经系统结局。迄今为止，低温TTM的任何可能获益均小于RCT中的目标。

## Accuracy of heparin-binding protein for the diagnosis of nosocomial meningitis and ventriculitis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The sensitive and accurate diagnosis of nosocomial meningitis and ventriculitis is still a critical problem. This study was designed to explore the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid heparin-binding protein (HBP) in nosocomial meningitis and ventriculitis in comparison with procalcitonin and lactate. 

METHODS: In this observational study, 323 suspected patients were enrolled, of which 42 participants were excluded because they could not be accurately grouped, 131 subjects who were eventually diagnosed with nosocomial meningitis or ventriculitis and 150 patients in whom infection was ultimately ruled out were included in the final analysis. The main results are expressed as medians (interquartile ranges). The Chi-squared test was used to compare the baseline characteristics. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for group and subgroup analyses. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to describe the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers. Spearman's partial correlation was used to analyze associations between the biomarkers. Statistical significance was set when p value < 0.05. 

RESULTS: HBP achieved the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.98-1.00) compared with 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99) for lactate and 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.75) for procalcitonin. With a cutoff level at 23 ng/mL, HBP achieved a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 98%. The levels of HBP presented no significant discrepancy between patients who received previous empiric anti-infective therapy and those who did not (p > 0.05). Higher concentrations of HBP were present in patients with positive microbiological findings (p < 0.05). Levels of HBP positively correlated with polymorphonuclear cell count (Spearman's rho = 0.68, p < 0.01), white blood cell count (Spearman's rho = 0.57, p < 0.01) and lactate (Spearman's rho = 0.34, p < 0.01). 

CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrospinal fluid heparin-binding protein is a reliable auxiliary diagnostic marker that is preferable over lactate and procalcitonin in identifying nosocomial meningitis and ventriculitis, and it also contributes to solving the diagnostic difficulties caused by empiric antibiotherapy.

##中文标题- 肝素结合蛋白对医院内脑膜炎和脑室炎诊断的准确性

**摘要**

背景：医院内获得性脑膜炎和脑室炎的敏感和准确诊断仍是一个关键问题。本研究旨在通过与降钙素原和乳酸比较，探讨脑脊液肝素结合蛋白(HBP)对医院内脑膜炎和脑室炎的诊断价值。

方法：在本观察性研究中，入组了323例疑似患者，其中42例受试者由于无法进行准确分组而被排除，131例最终诊断为医院内脑膜炎或脑室炎的受试者和150例最终排除感染的患者被纳入最终分析。主要结果以中位数（四分位距）表示。卡方检验用于比较基线特征。Mann-Whitney U检验用于组和亚组分析。计算受试者工作特征曲线下面积，以描述生物标志物的诊断准确性。使用Spearman部分相关性分析生物标志物之间的相关性。当p值 < 0.05时，设定为具有统计学显著性。

结果：HBP获得的受试者工作特征曲线下面积最大，为0.99（95%置信区间为0.98-1.00），而乳酸盐为0.98（95%置信区间为0.96-0.99），降钙素原为0.69（95%置信区间为0.62-0.75）。当临界水平为23 ng/mL时，HBP达到了97%的灵敏度、95%的特异性、93%的阳性预测值和98%的阴性预测值。既往接受经验性抗感染治疗和未接受经验性抗感染治疗的患者HBP水平无显著差异(p > 0.05)。微生物学结果阳性的患者HBP浓度更高(p < 0.05)。HBP水平与多形核细胞计数(Spearman rho = 0.68，p < 0.01)、白细胞计数(Spearman rho = 0.57，p < 0.01)和乳酸盐(Spearman rho = 0.34，p < 0.01)正相关。

结论：脑脊液肝素结合蛋白是一种可靠的辅助诊断标志物，在鉴别医院脑膜炎和脑室炎方面优于乳酸盐和降钙素原，同时有助于解决经验性抗生素治疗带来的诊断困难。

## Limitations of the ARDS criteria during high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation: evidence from critically ill COVID-19 patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)) during invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is used as criteria to grade the severity of respiratory failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, the use of PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio has been increasingly used in non-invasive respiratory support such as high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The grading of hypoxemia in non-invasively ventilated patients is uncertain. The main hypothesis, investigated in this study, was that the PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio does not change when switching between MV, NIV and HFNC. 

METHODS: We investigated respiratory function in critically ill patients with COVID-19 included in a single-center prospective observational study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden. In a steady state condition, the PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio was recorded before and after any change between two of the studied respiratory support techniques (i.e., HFNC, NIV and MV). 

RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were included in the present analysis. We find that any change in respiratory support from or to HFNC caused a significant change in PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio. Changes in respiratory support between NIV and MV did not show consistent change in PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio. In patients classified as mild to moderate ARDS during MV, the change from HFNC to MV showed a variable increase in PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio ranging between 52 and 140 mmHg (median of 127 mmHg). This made prediction of ARDS severity during MV from the apparent ARDS grade during HFNC impossible. 

CONCLUSIONS: HFNC is associated with lower PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio than either NIV or MV in the same patient, while NIV and MV provided similar PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) and thus ARDS grade by Berlin definition. The large variation of PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio indicates that great caution should be used when estimating ARDS grade as a measure of pulmonary damage during HFNC.

##中文标题- 高流量氧气或无创通气期间ARDS标准的局限性：来自COVID-19重症患者的证据

**摘要**

背景：有创机械通气(MV)时动脉血氧分压与吸入气氧分数的比值(PaO(2)/F(I)O(2))作为急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)呼吸衰竭严重程度分级的标准。在SARS-CoV2大流行期间，PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比值越来越多地用于无创呼吸支持，如高流量鼻插管(HFNC)和无创通气(NIV)。无创通气患者的低氧血症分级尚不确定。本研究探讨的主要假设是在MV、NIV和HFNC之间切换时，PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比率没有变化。

方法：我们研究了COVID-19重症患者的呼吸功能，这是一项单中心前瞻性观察研究，患者在瑞典乌普萨拉大学医院的重症监护室(ICU)住院。在稳态条件下，记录两种研究的呼吸支持技术（即HFNC、NIV和MV）之间任何变化前后的PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比值。

结果：本分析共纳入148例患者。我们发现，从HFNC到HFNC的呼吸支持的任何变化均引起PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比值的显著变化。NIV和MV之间的呼吸支持变化未显示PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比率的一致变化。在MV治疗期间归类为轻至中度ARDS的患者中，从HFNC至MV的变化显示，pao2/F(I)o2比值可变增加，范围为52至140 mmHg（中位数为127 mmHg）。这使得无法根据HFNC期间明显的ARDS分级预测MV期间的ARDS严重程度。

结论：在同一患者中，HFNC的PaO(2)/F(i)O(2)比率低于NIV或MV，而NIV和MV提供了相似的PaO(2)/F(i)O(2)，因此根据Berlin定义为ARDS分级。PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)比值的较大变化表明，在HFNC期间，作为肺损伤指标，估计ARDS分级时应非常谨慎。

##中文标题- 随机对照试验：新斯的明治疗急性胰腺炎的腹内高压

**摘要**

背景：急性胰腺炎(AP)中的腹内高压(IAH)与器官功能恶化相关。本试验旨在评估新斯的明治疗AP患者IAH的疗效。

方法：在本项单中心、随机试验中，同意AP发病2周内的IAH患者接受24h常规治疗，持续腹内压(IAP)≥12 mmHg的患者随机接受肌内新斯的明治疗（每12h1 mg，增至每8h或每6h1次），根据反应）或继续常规治疗7天。主要结局是随机分组后24h IAP的百分比变化。

结果：新斯的明组(n = 40)或常规治疗组(n = 40)共招募80例患者。基线参数无显著差异。在24h内，新斯的明组的IAP下降速度显著快于常规组（中位数第25-75百分位数：-18.7%[-28.4至  -4.7%]vs.-5.4%[-18.0%至0]，P = 0.017）。该效应在基线IAP≥15 mmHg的患者中更为明显(P = 0.018)。符合方案分析证实了这些结果(P = 0.03)。在7天的观察期内，新斯的明组的排便量始终较高（所有P < 0.05）。新斯的明和常规治疗组之间其他次要结局无显著差异。

结论：新斯的明减少AP和IAH患者的IAP，促进排便。这些结果需要进行更大型、安慰剂对照、双盲III期试验。

## Randomized controlled trial: neostigmine for intra-abdominal hypertension in acute pancreatitis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with deterioration in organ function. This trial aimed to assess the efficacy of neostigmine for IAH in patients with AP. 

METHODS: In this single-center, randomized trial, consenting patients with IAH within 2 weeks of AP onset received conventional treatment for 24 h. Patients with sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) ≥ 12 mmHg were randomized to receive intramuscular neostigmine (1 mg every 12 h increased to every 8 h or every 6 h, depending on response) or continue conventional treatment for 7 days. The primary outcome was the percent change of IAP at 24 h after randomization. 

RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were recruited to neostigmine (n = 40) or conventional treatment (n = 40). There was no significant difference in baseline parameters. The rate of decrease in IAP was significantly faster in the neostigmine group compared to the conventional group by 24 h (median with 25th-75th percentile: -18.7% [- 28.4 to  - 4.7%] vs. - 5.4% [- 18.0% to 0], P = 0.017). This effect was more pronounced in patients with baseline IAP ≥ 15 mmHg (P = 0.018). Per-protocol analysis confirmed these results (P = 0.03). Stool volume was consistently higher in the neostigmine group during the 7-day observational period (all P < 0.05). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between neostigmine and conventional treatment groups. 

CONCLUSION: Neostigmine reduced IAP and promoted defecation in patients with AP and IAH. These results warrant a larger, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III trial.

## Distribution of delirium motor subtypes in the intensive care unit: a systematic scoping review

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common cerebral dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can be subdivided into a hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed motor subtype based on the clinical manifestation. The aim of this review was to describe the distribution, pharmacological interventions, and outcomes of delirium motor subtypes in ICU patients. 

METHODS: This systematic scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA-ScR and Cochrane guidelines. We performed a systematic search in six major databases to identify relevant studies. A meta-regression analysis was performed where pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were computed by a random effect model. 

RESULTS: We included 131 studies comprising 13,902 delirious patients. There was a large between-study heterogeneity among studies, including differences in study design, setting, population, and outcome reporting. Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent delirium motor subtype (50.3% [95% CI 46.0-54.7]), followed by mixed delirium (27.7% [95% CI 24.1-31.3]) and hyperactive delirium (22.7% [95% CI 19.0-26.5]). When comparing the delirium motor subtypes, patients with mixed delirium experienced the longest delirium duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, the highest ICU and hospital mortality, and more frequently received administration of specific agents (antipsychotics, α2-agonists, benzodiazepines, and propofol) during ICU stay. In studies with high average age for delirious patients (> 65 years), patients were more likely to experience hypoactive delirium. 

CONCLUSIONS: Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent motor subtype in critically ill patients. Mixed delirium had the worst outcomes in terms of delirium duration, length of stay, and mortality, and received more pharmacological interventions compared to other delirium motor subtypes. Few studies contributed to secondary outcomes; hence, these results should be interpreted with care. The large between-study heterogeneity suggests that a more standardized methodology in delirium research is warranted.

##中文标题- 重症监护室中谵妄运动亚型的分布：一项系统范围审查

**摘要**

背景：谵妄是重症监护室(ICU)最常见的脑功能障碍，根据临床表现可细分为活动减退型、活动过度型或混合型运动亚型。本综述旨在描述ICU患者中谵妄运动亚型的分布、药物干预和结局。

方法：根据PRISMA-ScR和Cochrane指南进行系统性范围审查。我们在6个主要数据库中进行了系统性检索，以确定相关研究。进行荟萃-回归分析，通过随机效应模型计算95%置信区间的合并估计值。

结果：我们纳入了131项研究，包括13,902例谵妄患者。研究之间存在较大的研究间异质性，包括研究设计、环境、人群和结局报告的差异。活动减退性谵妄是最常见的谵妄运动亚型(50.3%[95%CI 46.0-54.7])，其次是混合性谵妄(27.7%[95%CI 24.1-31.3])和活动过度性谵妄(22.7%[95%CI 19.0-26.5])。比较谵妄运动亚型时，混合型谵妄患者在ICU住院期间经历的谵妄持续时间、ICU和住院时间最长，ICU和住院死亡率最高，接受特定药物（抗精神病药物、α2-受体激动剂、苯二氮卓类药物和丙泊酚）的频率更高。在谵妄患者平均年龄较高（> 65岁）的研究中，患者更可能发生活动减退性谵妄。

结论：活动减退性谵妄是重症患者中最常见的运动亚型。混合型谵妄在谵妄持续时间、住院时间和死亡率方面的结局最差，与其他谵妄运动亚型相比，接受了更多的药物干预。少数研究贡献了次要结局；因此，应谨慎解释这些结果。研究间的巨大异质性表明，在谵妄研究中需要更标准化的方法。

## Adverse effects of delayed antimicrobial treatment and surgical source control in adults with sepsis: results of a planned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Timely antimicrobial treatment and source control are strongly recommended by sepsis guidelines, however, their impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain. 

METHODS: We performed a planned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial conducted from July 2011 to May 2015 including forty German hospitals. All adult patients with sepsis treated in the participating ICUs were included. Primary exposures were timing of antimicrobial therapy and delay of surgical source control during the first 48 h after sepsis onset. Primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Mixed models were used to investigate the effects of timing while adjusting for confounders. The linearity of the effect was investigated by fractional polynomials and by categorizing of timing. 

RESULTS: Analyses were based on 4792 patients receiving antimicrobial treatment and 1595 patients undergoing surgical source control. Fractional polynomial analysis identified a linear effect of timing of antimicrobials on 28-day mortality, which increased by 0.42% per hour delay (OR with 95% CI 1.019 [1.01, 1.028], p ≤ 0.001). This effect was significant in patients with and without shock (OR = 1.018 [1.008, 1.029] and 1.026 [1.01, 1.043], respectively). Using a categorized timing variable, there were no significant differences comparing treatment within 1 h versus 1-3 h, or 1 h versus 3-6 h. Delays of more than 6 h significantly increased mortality (OR = 1.41 [1.17, 1.69]). Delay in antimicrobials also increased risk of progression from severe sepsis to septic shock (OR per hour: 1.051 [1.022, 1.081], p ≤ 0.001). Time to surgical source control was significantly associated with decreased odds of successful source control (OR = 0.982 [0.971, 0.994], p = 0.003) and increased odds of death (OR = 1.011 [1.001, 1.021]; p = 0.03) in unadjusted analysis, but not when adjusted for confounders (OR = 0.991 [0.978, 1.005] and OR = 1.008 [0.997, 1.02], respectively). Only, among patients with septic shock delay of source control was significantly related to risk-of death (adjusted OR = 1.013 [1.001, 1.026], p = 0.04). 

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that management of sepsis is time critical both for antimicrobial therapy and source control. Also patients, who are not yet in septic shock, profit from early anti-infective treatment since it can prevent further deterioration.

##中文标题- 脓毒症成人患者延迟抗菌治疗和手术源控制的不良反应：一项集群随机对照试验的计划次要分析结果

**摘要**

背景：脓毒症指南强烈建议及时进行抗菌治疗和来源控制，然而，其对临床结局的影响尚不确定。

方法：我们对2011年7月至2015年5月进行的包括40家德国医院的集群随机试验进行了计划的二次分析。纳入所有在参与ICU接受治疗的脓毒症成人患者。主要暴露是抗菌治疗的时间和败血症发生后的前48h内手术源控制的延迟。主要终点为28天死亡率。混合模型用于研究时间效应，同时调整混杂因素。通过分数多项式和时间分类研究了效应的线性。

结果：分析基于4792名接受抗菌治疗的患者和1595名接受手术源控制的患者。分数多项式分析确定了抗菌剂使用时间对28天死亡率的线性效应，每小时延迟增加0.42%（OR的95%CI为1.019[1.01，1.028]，p≤0.001）。在有和无休克的患者中该效应显著（OR分别为1.018[1.008，1.029]和1.026[1.01，1.043]）。使用分类的时间变量，比较1h内与1-3h或1h与3-6h的治疗，没有显著差异。延迟超过6h显著增加死亡率(or = 1.41[1.17，1.69])。抗菌剂延迟也增加了从重度败血症进展为感染性休克的风险（每小时OR：1.051[1.022，1.081]，p≤0.001）。在未校正的分析中，至手术源控制的时间与成功源控制的几率下降(OR = 0.982[0.971，0.994]，p = 0.003)和死亡的几率增加(OR = 1.011[1.001，1.021]；p = 0.03)显著相关，但当校正混杂因素时（OR = 0.991[0.978，1.005]和OR = 1.008[0.997,1.02]）。仅在脓毒性休克患者中，来源控制延迟与死亡风险显著相关（调整后OR = 1.013[1.001，1.026]，p = 0.04）。

结论：我们的研究结果表明，败血症的管理对于抗菌治疗和来源控制都是至关重要的。此外，还未处于感染性休克的患者可从早期抗感染治疗中获益，因为早期抗感染治疗可防止病情进一步恶化。

## The role of cell-free hemoglobin and haptoglobin in acute kidney injury in critically ill adults with ARDS and therapy with VV ECMO

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Increased plasma concentrations of circulating cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) are supposed to contribute to the multifactorial etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients while the CFH-scavenger haptoglobin might play a protective role. We evaluated the association of CFH and haptoglobin with AKI in patients with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring therapy with VV ECMO. 

METHODS: Patients with CFH and haptoglobin measurements before initiation of ECMO therapy were identified from a cohort of 1044 ARDS patients and grouped into three CFH concentration groups using a risk stratification. The primary objective was to assess the association of CFH and haptoglobin with KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Further objectives included the identification of a target haptoglobin concentration to protect from CFH-associated AKI. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 

RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-three patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of those, 154 patients (56.4%) had AKI at ECMO initiation. The incidence of AKI increased stepwise with increasing concentrations of CFH reaching a plateau at 15 mg/dl. Compared to patients with low [< 5 mg/dl] CFH concentrations, patients with moderate [5-14 mg/dl] and high [≥ 15 mg/dl] CFH concentrations had a three- and five-fold increased risk for AKI (adjusted odds ratio [OR] moderate vs. low, 2.69 [95% CI, 1.25-5.95], P = 0.012; and OR high vs. low, 5.47 [2.00-15.9], P = 0.001). Among patients with increased CFH concentrations, haptoglobin plasma levels were lower in patients with AKI compared to patients without AKI. A haptoglobin concentration greater than 2.7 g/l in the moderate and 2.4 g/l in the high CFH group was identified as clinical cutoff value to protect from CFH-associated AKI (sensitivity 89.5% [95% CI, 83-96] and 90.2% [80-97], respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with ARDS requiring therapy with VV ECMO, an increased plasma concentration of CFH was identified as independent risk factor for AKI. Among patients with increased CFH concentrations, higher plasma haptoglobin concentrations might protect from CFH-associated AKI and should be subject of future research.

##中文标题- 无细胞血红蛋白和结合珠蛋白在ARDS重症成人急性肾损伤和VV ECMO治疗中的作用

**摘要**

背景：循环细胞游离血红蛋白(CFH)的血浆浓度升高被认为是造成重症患者发生急性肾损伤(AKI)的多因素病因，而CFH-清除剂结合珠蛋白可能起到了保护作用。我们评估了需要VV ECMO治疗的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者中CFH和结合珠蛋白与AKI的相关性。

方法：从1044例ARDS患者队列中确定在开始ECMO治疗前具有CFH和结合珠蛋白测量值的患者，并采用风险分层将其分为3个CFH浓度组。主要目的是评估CFH和结合珠蛋白与KDIGO 3期AKI的相关性。其他目的包括确定结合珠蛋白靶浓度，以预防CFH相关AKI。测量和主要

结果：273例患者符合入选标准。其中，154例患者(56.4%)在ECMO启动时发生AKI。AKI的发生率随着CFH浓度的升高而逐步升高，在15 mg/dL时达到平台期。与CFH浓度低[< 5 mg/dL]的患者相比，CFH浓度中等[5-14 mg/dL]和高[≥15 mg/dL]的患者发生AKI的风险分别增加3倍和5倍（调整后的比值比[OR]中等与低，2.69[95%CI,1.25-5.95],P = 0.012；OR高与低，5.47[2.00-15.9],P = 0.001）。在CFH浓度升高的患者中，AKI患者的结合珠蛋白血浆水平低于无AKI患者。中度CFH组结合珠蛋白浓度大于2.7 g/L和高CFH组结合珠蛋白浓度大于2.4 g/L被确定为预防CFH相关AKI的临床临界值（灵敏度分别为89.5%[95%CI，83-96]和90.2%[80-97]）。

结论：在需要接受VV ECMO治疗的ARDS重症患者中，CFH血浆浓度升高被确定为AKI的独立风险因素。在CFH浓度升高的患者中，较高的血浆结合珠蛋白浓度可能会预防CFH相关AKI，应作为未来研究的对象。

## Impact of platelet transfusion on outcomes in trauma patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Trauma-induced coagulopathy includes thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction that impact patient outcome. Nevertheless, the role of platelet transfusion remains poorly defined. The aim of the study was 1/ to evaluate the impact of early platelet transfusion on 24-h all-cause mortality and 2/ to describe platelet count at admission (PCA) and its relationship with trauma severity and outcome. 

METHODS: Observational study carried out on a multicentre prospective trauma registry. All adult trauma patients directly admitted in participating trauma centres between May 2011 and June 2019 were included. Severe haemorrhage was defined as ≥ 4 red blood cell units within 6 h and/or death from exsanguination. The impact of PCA and early platelet transfusion (i.e. within the first 6 h) on 24-h all-cause mortality was assessed using uni- and multivariate logistic regression. 

RESULTS: Among the 19,596 included patients, PCA (229 G/L [189,271]) was associated with coagulopathy, traumatic burden, shock and bleeding severity. In a logistic regression model, 24-h all-cause mortality increased by 37% for every 50 G/L decrease in platelet count (OR 0.63 95% CI 0.57-0.70; p < 0.001). Regarding patients with severe hemorrhage, platelets were transfused early for 36% of patients. Early platelet transfusion was associated with a decrease in 24-h all-cause mortality (versus no or late platelets): OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34-0.79; p < 0.05). 

CONCLUSIONS: PCA, although mainly in normal range, was associated with trauma severity and coagulopathy and was predictive of bleeding intensity and outcome. Early platelet transfusion within 6 h was associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with severe hemorrhage. Future studies are needed to determine which doses of platelet transfusion will improve outcomes after major trauma.

##中文标题- 血小板输注对创伤患者结局的影响

**摘要**

背景：创伤诱导的凝血病包括影响患者结局的血小板减少症和血小板功能障碍。然而，血小板输注的作用仍不明确。本研究的目的是1/评价早期血小板输注对24h全因死亡率的影响，2/描述入院时血小板计数(PCA)及其与创伤严重程度和结局的关系。

方法：对一项多中心前瞻性创伤登记研究进行观察性研究。纳入2011年5月至2019年6月期间直接在参与创伤中心住院的所有成人创伤患者。重度出血定义为6h内红细胞单位≥4和/或放血后死亡。使用单因素和多因素logistic回归评估了PCA和早期血小板输注（即在前6h内）对24h全因死亡率的影响。

结果：在纳入的19,596例患者中，PCA(229 g/L[189,271])与凝血病、创伤负荷、休克和出血严重程度相关。在logistic回归模型中，血小板计数每降低50 g/L，24h全因死亡率增加37%(OR 0.63 95%CI 0.57-0.70；p < 0.001)。关于重度出血患者，36%的患者早期输注血小板。早期血小板输注与24h全因死亡率降低相关（与无或晚期血小板相比）：or 0.52(95%CI 0.34-0.79；p < 0.05)。

结论：PCA虽然主要在正常范围，但与创伤严重程度和凝血病相关，并可预测出血强度和结局。在严重出血患者中，6h内早期血小板输注与死亡率降低相关。需要进一步的研究来确定哪种血小板输注剂量将改善重大创伤后的结局。

## Treatment of COVID-19-associated ARDS with mesenchymal stromal cells: a multicenter randomized double-blind trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causes high mortality. Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) have potentially relevant immune-modulatory properties, whose place in ARDS treatment is not established. This phase 2b trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy of UC-MSCs in patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. 

METHODS: This multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (STROMA-CoV-2) recruited adults (≥ 18 years) with SARS-CoV-2-induced early (< 96 h) mild-to-severe ARDS in 10 French centres. Patients were randomly assigned to receive three intravenous infusions of 10(6) UC-MSCs/kg or placebo (0.9% NaCl) over 5 days after recruitment. For the modified intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint was the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2))-ratio change between baseline (day (D) 0) and D7. 

RESULTS: Among the 107 patients screened for eligibility from April 6, 2020, to October 29, 2020, 45 were enrolled, randomized and analyzed. PaO(2)/FiO(2) changes between D0 and D7 did not differ significantly between the UC-MSCs and placebo groups (medians [IQR] 54.3 [- 15.5 to 93.3] vs 25.3 [- 33.3 to 104.6], respectively; ANCOVA estimated treatment effect 7.4, 95% CI - 44.7 to 59.7; P = 0.77). Six (28.6%) of the 21 UC-MSCs recipients and six of 24 (25%) placebo-group patients experienced serious adverse events, none of which were related to UC-MSCs treatment. 

CONCLUSIONS: D0-to-D7 PaO(2)/FiO(2) changes for intravenous UC-MSCs-versus placebo-treated adults with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS did not differ significantly. Repeated UC-MSCs infusions were not associated with any serious adverse events during treatment or thereafter (until D28). Larger trials enrolling patients earlier during the course of their ARDS are needed to further assess UC-MSCs efficacy in this context.

##中文标题- 间充质基质细胞治疗COVID-19相关ARDS：一项多中心随机双盲试验

**摘要**

背景：严重急性呼吸综合征冠状病毒-2(SARS-CoV-2)诱导的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)导致高死亡率。脐带来源的间充质基质细胞(UC-MSCs)具有潜在的相关免疫调节特性，其在ARDS治疗中的地位尚不明确。这项2b期试验的目的是评估UC-MSCs对SARS-CoV-2诱导的ARDS患者的疗效。

方法：这项多中心、双盲、随机、安慰剂对照试验(STROMA-CoV-2)招募了10个法国中心的成人（≥18岁）SARS-CoV-2诱导的早期(< 96 h)轻度至重度ARDS患者。招募完成后，患者随机接受3次10(6)UC-MSCs/kg或安慰剂(0.9%NaCl)静脉输注，持续5天。对于改良的意向性治疗人群，主要终点是基线（第(D)0天）和D7之间的氧分压与吸入氧分数(PaO(2)/FiO(2))比值变化。

结果：在2020年4月6日至2020年10月29日筛选合格的107例患者中，45例入组、随机化并分析。UC-MSCs组和安慰剂组之间D0至D7期间的PaO(2)/FiO(2)变化无显著差异（中位数[IQR]分别为54.3[-15.5至93.3]vs 25.3[-33.3至104.6]；ANCOVA估计的治疗效果为7.4，95%CI-44.7至59.7；P = 0.77）。21例UC-MSCs受者中6例(28.6%)和24例安慰剂组患者中6例(25%)发生严重不良事件，均与UC-MSCs治疗无关。

结论：在SARS-CoV-2诱导的ARDS成人中，与安慰剂治疗相比，UC-MSCs静脉给药的D0-D7 PaO(2)/FiO(2)变化无显著差异。治疗期间或之后（直至D28）重复输注UC-MSCs未引起任何严重不良事件。需要在ARDS早期入组患者的大型试验进一步评估UC-MSCs在这种情况下的疗效。

## Repeated endo-tracheal tube disconnection generates pulmonary edema in a model of volume overload: an experimental study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: An abrupt lung deflation in rodents results in lung injury through vascular mechanisms. Ventilator disconnections during endo-tracheal suctioning in humans often cause cardio-respiratory instability. Whether repeated disconnections or lung deflations cause lung injury or oedema is not known and was tested here in a porcine large animal model. 

METHODS: Yorkshire pigs (~ 12 weeks) were studied in three series. First, we compared PEEP abruptly deflated from 26 cmH(2)O or from PEEP 5 cmH(2)O to zero. Second, pigs were randomly crossed over to receive rapid versus gradual PEEP removal from 20 cmH(2)O. Third, pigs with relative volume overload, were ventilated with PEEP 15 cmH(2)O and randomized to repeated ETT disconnections (15 s every 15 min) or no disconnection for 3 h. Hemodynamics, pulmonary variables were monitored, and lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage studied. 

RESULTS: As compared to PEEP 5 cmH(2)O, abrupt deflation from PEEP 26 cmH(2)O increased PVR, lowered oxygenation, and increased lung wet-to-dry ratio. From PEEP 20 cmH(2)O, gradual versus abrupt deflation mitigated the changes in oxygenation and vascular resistance. From PEEP 15, repeated disconnections in presence of fluid loading led to reduced compliance, lower oxygenation, higher pulmonary artery pressure, higher lung wet-to-dry ratio, higher lung injury score and increased oedema on morphometry, compared to no disconnects. 

CONCLUSION: Single abrupt deflation from high PEEP, and repeated short deflations from moderate PEEP cause pulmonary oedema, impaired oxygenation, and increased PVR, in this large animal model, thus replicating our previous finding from rodents. Rapid deflation may thus be a clinically relevant cause of impaired lung function, which may be attenuated by gradual pressure release.

##中文标题- 容量超负荷模型中反复气管插管断开引起肺水肿的实验研究

**摘要**

背景：啮齿类动物突然的肺放气通过血管机制导致肺损伤。人体气管内吸痰时呼吸机断开常引起心肺不稳定。尚不清楚反复断开或肺放气是否会导致肺损伤或水肿，在猪大型动物模型中进行了测试。

方法：在3个系列中对约克夏猪（约12周）进行研究。首先，我们将PEEP从26 cmH(2)O突然放气或从5 cmH(2)O突然放气的PEEP与零进行比较。其次，将猪随机交叉接受从20 cmH(2)O开始的快速与逐渐PEEP清除。第三，对相对容量超负荷猪，使用PEEP 15 cmH(2)O进行通气，并随机分配至重复ETT断开组（每15 min15s）或不断开组，持续3h。监测血液动力学、肺变量，研究了肺组织学和支气管肺泡灌洗。

结果：与PEEP 5cmh2 O相比，PEEP 26 cmh2 O突然放气导致PVR升高、氧合降低和肺湿干比升高。从PEEP 20 cmh2o(2)O开始，逐渐与突然放气缓解了氧合和血管阻力的变化。从PEEP 15开始，在液体负荷存在的情况下反复断开导致与无断开相比，顺应性降低、氧合降低、肺动脉压升高、肺湿干比升高、肺损伤评分升高和形态学水肿增加。

结论：在该大型动物模型中，高PEEP的单次突然放气和中度PEEP的重复短时间放气导致肺水肿、氧合受损和PVR升高，从而复制了我们之前在啮齿类动物中的发现。因此，快速放气可能是肺功能受损的临床相关原因，通过逐渐释放压力可减弱。

## Actively implementing an evidence-based feeding guideline for critically ill patients (NEED): a multicenter, cluster-randomized, controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Previous cluster-randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of implementing evidence-based guidelines for nutrition therapy in critical illness do not consistently demonstrate patient benefits. A large-scale, sufficiently powered study is therefore warranted to ascertain the effects of guideline implementation on patient-centered outcomes. 

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, cluster-randomized, parallel-controlled trial in intensive care units (ICUs) across China. We developed an evidence-based feeding guideline. ICUs randomly allocated to the guideline group formed a local "intervention team", which actively implemented the guideline using standardized educational materials, a graphical feeding protocol, and live online education outreach meetings conducted by members of the study management committee. ICUs assigned to the control group remained unaware of the guideline content. All ICUs enrolled patients who were expected to stay in the ICU longer than seven days. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days of enrollment. 

RESULTS: Forty-eight ICUs were randomized to the guideline group and 49 to the control group. From March 2018 to July 2019, the guideline ICUs enrolled 1399 patients, and the control ICUs enrolled 1373 patients. Implementation of the guideline resulted in significantly earlier EN initiation (1.20 vs. 1.55 mean days to initiation of EN; difference - 0.40 [95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.09]; P = 0.01) and delayed PN initiation (1.29 vs. 0.80 mean days to start of PN; difference 1.06 [95% CI 0.44 to 1.67]; P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (14.2% vs. 15.2%; difference - 1.6% [95% CI - 4.3% to 1.2%]; P = 0.42) between groups. 

CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, multicenter trial, active implementation of an evidence-based feeding guideline reduced the time to commencement of EN and overall PN use but did not translate to a reduction in mortality from critical illness.

##中文标题- 积极实施以证据为基础的危重患者喂养指南(NEED)：一项多中心、整群随机、对照试验

**摘要**

背景：既往评价在危重病中实施循证营养治疗指南影响的集群随机对照试验未一致显示患者获益。因此，有必要进行一项大规模、具有足够效能的研究，以确定指南实施对以患者为中心的结局的影响。

方法：我们在中国的重症监护室(ICU)进行了一项多中心、整群随机、平行对照试验。我们制定了循证医学的喂养指南。随机分配至指南组的ICU组成当地“干预小组”，使用标准化教育材料、图示喂养方案和研究管理委员会成员召开的现场在线教育外展会议积极实施指南。分配至对照组的ICU仍不清楚指南内容。所有ICU入组预期在ICU住院7天以上的患者。主要结局为入组后28天内的全因死亡率。

结果：48个ICU被随机分入指南组，49个ICU被分入对照组。2018年3月至2019年7月，指南ICU入组1399例患者，对照ICU入组1373例患者。指南的实施导致EN开始时间显著提前（1.20 vs. 1.55平均开始EN天数；差异-0.40[95%CI-0.71至-0.09]；P = 0.01）和PN开始时间显著延迟（1.29 vs. 0.80平均开始PN天数；差异1.06[95%CI 0.44至1.67]；P = 0.001）。两组之间的28天死亡率无显著差异（14.2%vs. 15.2%；差异-1.6%[95%CI-4.3%至1.2%]；P = 0.42）。

结论：在这项大规模、多中心试验中，积极实施循证喂养指南减少了开始EN和总体PN使用的时间，但未转化为危重症死亡率的降低。

##中文标题- 脓毒性休克患者急诊入院时间与存活脓毒症集束化活动依从性的关系

**摘要**

背景：夜间住院通常与各种疾病的死亡风险增加相关。本研究调查了存活脓毒症运动(SSC)3h集束化在日间和夜间急诊科(ED)入院时的依从率，以及依从性对脓毒性休克患者死亡率的临床影响。

方法：我们使用2015年11月至2017年12月由韩国休克协会提供的脓毒性休克前瞻性、多中心登记数据进行了一项观察性研究。根据到达ED的时间，结局是SSC 3h成套方案的依从率。

结果：共纳入2049例患者。与日间入院相比，夜间入院与3h内抗生素给药的更高依从性相关（调整比值比[adjOR]，1.326；95%置信区间[95%CI]，1.088-1.617，p = 0.005），与完整SSC束支(adjOR，1.368；95%CI，1.115-1.678；p = 0.003)相关，可能是由于所有患者和败血症患者在白天入院的量增加。完成SSC束对于28天死亡率和住院死亡率的风险比分别为0.750(95%CI 0.590-0.952，p = 0.018)和0.714(95%CI 0.564-0.904，p = 0.005)。

结论：在日间进入ED的感染性休克患者显示出比夜间进入ED的患者更低的脓毒症束依从性。入院患者数量较多和日间患者与医务人员的比例较高可能是导致依从性降低的因素。

## Relationship between time of emergency department admission and adherence to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundle in patients with septic shock

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Nighttime hospital admission is often associated with increased mortality risk in various diseases. This study investigated compliance rates with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 3-h bundle for daytime and nighttime emergency department (ED) admissions and the clinical impact of compliance on mortality in patients with septic shock. 

METHODS: We conducted an observational study using data from a prospective, multicenter registry for septic shock provided by the Korean Shock Society from 11 institutions from November 2015 to December 2017. The outcome was the compliance rate with the SSC 3-h bundle according to the time of arrival in the ED. 

RESULTS: A total of 2049 patients were enrolled. Compared with daytime admission, nighttime admission was associated with higher compliance with the administration of antibiotics within 3 h (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR), 1.326; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.088-1.617, p = 0.005) and with the complete SSC bundle (adjOR, 1.368; 95% CI, 1.115-1.678; p = 0.003), likely to result from the increased volume of all patients and sepsis patients admitted during daytime hours. The hazard ratios of the completion of SSC bundle for 28-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were 0.750 (95% CI 0.590-0.952, p = 0.018) and 0.714 (95% CI 0.564-0.904, p = 0.005), respectively. 

CONCLUSION: Septic shock patients admitted to the ED during the daytime exhibited lower sepsis bundle compliance than those admitted at night. Both the higher number of admitted patients and the higher patients to medical staff ratio during daytime may be factors that are responsible for lowering the compliance.

## Tracheostomy timing and clinical outcomes in ventilated COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The association of tracheostomy timing and clinical outcomes in ventilated COVID-19 patients remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy on COVID-19 patients' outcomes. 

METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus database, along with medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Research Square, from December 1, 2019, to August 24, 2021. Early tracheostomy was defined as a tracheostomy conducted 14 days or less after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Late tracheostomy was any time thereafter. Duration of IMV, duration of ICU stay, and overall mortality were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) or the mean differences (MD) with 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. 

RESULTS: Fourteen studies with a cumulative 2371 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients were included in this review. Early tracheostomy was associated with significant reductions in duration of IMV (2098 patients; MD - 9.08 days, 95% CI - 10.91 to - 7.26 days, p < 0.01) and duration of ICU stay (1224 patients; MD - 9.41 days, 95% CI - 12.36 to - 6.46 days, p < 0.01). Mortality was reported for 2343 patients and was comparable between groups (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79-1.51, p = 0.59). 

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that, compared with late tracheostomy, early tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients was associated with shorter duration of IMV and ICU stay without modifying the mortality rate. These findings may have important implications to improve ICU availability during the COVID-19 pandemic.

##中文标题- COVID-19通气患者的气管造口术时机和临床结局：系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：通气COVID-19患者的气管造口术时机与临床结局的相关性仍有争议。我们进行了一项荟萃分析，以评价早期气管造口术与晚期气管造口术对COVID-19患者结局的影响。

方法：我们检索了Medline、Embase、Cochrane和Scopus数据库，以及medRxiv、bioRxiv和Research Square，时间范围为2019年12月1日至2021年8月24日。早期气管造口术定义为开始有创机械通气(IMV)后≤14天进行的气管造口术。此后任何时间均进行晚期气管造口术。IMV持续时间、ICU停留时间和总死亡率是荟萃分析的主要结局。使用随机效应模型计算合并比值比(OR)或平均差异(MD)及95%CI。

结果：本综述纳入了14项研究，累积纳入2371例气管切开COVID-19患者。早期气管造口术与IMV持续时间（2098例患者；MD-9.08天，95%CI-10.91至-7.26天，p < 0.01）和ICU停留时间（1224例患者；MD-9.41天，95%CI-12.36至-6.46天，p < 0.01）显著缩短相关。2343名患者报告了死亡率，治疗组间死亡率相当(OR 1.09，95%CI 0.79-1.51，p = 0.59)。

结论：这项荟萃分析的结果表明，与晚期气管造口术相比，COVID-19患者早期气管造口术与IMV和ICU住院时间更短有关，而没有改变死亡率。这些结果可能对改善COVID-19大流行期间ICU的可用性具有重要意义。

## Non-invasive oxygenation support in acutely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU: a multicenter observational retrospective study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive oxygenation strategies have a prominent role in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the efficacy of these therapies has been studied in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the clinical outcomes associated with oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients remain unclear. 

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used the best of nine covariate balancing algorithms on all baseline covariates in critically ill COVID-19 patients supported with > 10 L of supplemental oxygen at one of the 26 participating ICUs in Catalonia, Spain, between March 14 and April 15, 2020. 

RESULTS: Of the 1093 non-invasively oxygenated patients at ICU admission treated with one of the three stand-alone non-invasive oxygenation strategies, 897 (82%) required endotracheal intubation and 310 (28%) died during the ICU stay. High-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula (n = 439) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 101) were associated with a lower rate of endotracheal intubation (70% and 88%, respectively) than oxygen masks (n = 553 and 91% intubated), p < 0.001. Compared to oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula was associated with lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.58-0.98), and the hazard ratio for ICU mortality was 1.21 [95% CI 0.80-1.83] for non-invasive mechanical ventilation. 

CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients and, in the absence of conclusive data, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula may be the approach of choice as the primary non-invasive oxygenation support strategy.

##中文标题- ICU中急性低氧血症COVID-19患者的无创氧合支持：一项多中心观察性回顾性研究

**摘要**

背景：无创氧合策略在2019年冠状病毒病(COVID-19)期间急性低氧性呼吸衰竭的治疗中具有显著作用。尽管已在COVID-19住院患者中研究了这些治疗的疗效，但与氧面罩、经鼻插管的高流量氧疗和重症重症监护室(ICU)患者中的无创机械通气相关的临床结局仍不清楚。

方法：在这项回顾性研究中，我们在2020年3月14日至2020年4月15日在西班牙加泰罗尼亚的26个参与ICU中的1个中，对接受 > 10 L辅助供氧的危重COVID-19患者的所有基线协变量使用了9种协变量平衡算法中的最佳算法。

结果：1093例入住ICU时接受3种独立无创氧合策略之一治疗的无创氧合患者中，897例(82%)需要气管插管，310例(28%)在ICU住院期间死亡。经鼻插管的高流量氧疗(n = 439)和无创机械通气(n = 101)的气管插管率（分别为70%和88%）低于氧气面罩（n = 553和91%插管），p < 0.001。与吸氧面罩相比，经鼻插管的高流量氧疗与ICU死亡率降低相关（风险比0.75[95%CI 0.58-0.98]），无创机械通气的ICU死亡率风险比为1.21[95%CI 0.80-1.83]。

结论：在COVID-19 ICU重症患者中，在缺乏结论性数据的情况下，经鼻插管高流量氧疗可能是主要的无创氧合支持策略的首选方法。

## Detection of cerebral hypoperfusion with a dynamic hyperoxia test using brain oxygenation pressure monitoring

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Brain multimodal monitoring including intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO(2)) is more accurate than ICP alone in detecting cerebral hypoperfusion after traumatic brain injury (TBI). No data are available for the predictive role of a dynamic hyperoxia test in brain-injured patients from diverse etiology. AIM: To examine the accuracy of ICP, PbtO(2) and the oxygen ratio (OxR) in detecting regional cerebral hypoperfusion, assessed using perfusion cerebral computed tomography (CTP) in patients with acute brain injury. 

METHODS: Single-center study including patients with TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) undergoing cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements using CTP, concomitantly to ICP and PbtO(2) monitoring. Before CTP, FiO(2) was increased directly from baseline to 100% for a period of 20 min under stable conditions to test the PbtO(2) catheter, as a standard of care. Cerebral monitoring data were recorded and samples were taken, allowing the measurement of arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) and PbtO(2) at FiO(2) 100% as well as calculation of OxR (= ΔPbtO(2)/ΔPaO(2)). Regional CBF (rCBF) was measured using CTP in the tissue area around intracranial monitoring by an independent radiologist, who was blind to the PbtO(2) values. The accuracy of different monitoring tools to predict cerebral hypoperfusion (i.e., CBF < 35 mL/100 g × min) was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs). 

RESULTS: Eighty-seven CTPs were performed in 53 patients (median age 52 [41-63] years-TBI, n = 17; SAH, n = 29; ICH, n = 7). Cerebral hypoperfusion was observed in 56 (64%) CTPs: ICP, PbtO(2) and OxR were significantly different between CTP with and without hypoperfusion. Also, rCBF was correlated with ICP (r = - 0.27; p = 0.01), PbtO(2) (r = 0.36; p < 0.01) and OxR (r = 0.57; p < 0.01). Compared with ICP alone (AUC = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]), monitoring ICP + PbO(2) (AUC = 0.78 [0.68-0.87]) or ICP + PbtO(2) + OxR (AUC = 0.80 (0.70-0.91) was significantly more accurate in predicting cerebral hypoperfusion. The accuracy was not significantly different among different etiologies of brain injury. 

CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ICP and PbtO(2) monitoring provides a better detection of cerebral hypoperfusion than ICP alone in patients with acute brain injury. The use of dynamic hyperoxia test could not significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy.

##中文标题- 脑氧合压力监测动态高氧试验检测脑低灌注

**摘要**

引言：包括颅内压(ICP)和脑组织氧分压(PbtO(2))的脑多模式监测比单独使用ICP更准确地检测创伤性脑损伤(TBI)后的脑低灌注。尚无数据表明动态高氧试验对不同病因的脑损伤患者的预测作用。目的：利用灌注脑计算机断层扫描(CTP)评估急性脑损伤患者ICP、PbtO(2)和氧比(OxR)检测局部脑灌注不足的准确性。

方法：单中心研究，纳入TBI、蛛网膜下腔出血(SAH)和颅内出血(ICH)患者，使用CTP测量脑血流量(CBF)，同时进行ICP和PbtO(2)监测。在CTP前，FiO(2)在稳定条件下直接从基线增加到100%持续20 min，以测试PbtO(2)导管，作为标准治疗。记录脑监测数据并采样，允许在FiO(2)100%时测量动脉血氧分压(PaO(2))和PbtO(2)，并计算OxR(= ΔPbtO(2)/ΔPaO(2))。局部脑血流量(rCBF)由独立的放射科医生使用CTP在颅内监测周围的组织区域进行测量，该医生不知道PbtO(2)值。使用受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUC)评估不同监测工具预测脑灌注不足（即，CBF < 35 mL/100 g×min）的准确性。

结果：53例患者进行了87次CTP（中位年龄52[41-63]岁-TBI，n = 17；SAH，n = 29；ICH，n = 7）。在56例(64%)CTP中观察到脑灌注不足：ICP、PbtO(2)和OxR在CTP伴和不伴灌注不足之间有显著差异。此外，rCBF与ICP(r =-0.27；p = 0.01)、PbtO(2)(r = 0.36；p < 0.01)和OxR(r = 0.57；p < 0.01)相关。与单纯ICP(AUC = 0.65[95%CI，0.53-0.76])相比，监测ICP + PbO(2)(AUC = 0.78[0.68-0.87])或ICP + PbtO(2)+ OxR（AUC = 0.80(0.70-0.91)预测脑低灌注更准确。不同病因脑损伤的准确性无显著差异。

结论：在急性脑损伤患者中，ICP与PbtO(2)联合监测比ICP单独监测提供了更好的脑低灌注检测。动态高氧试验不能显著提高诊断的准确性。

## Multidimensional analysis of the host response reveals prognostic and pathogen-driven immune subtypes among adults with sepsis in Uganda

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The global burden of sepsis is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe infections disproportionately affect young, HIV-infected adults and high-burden pathogens are unique. In this context, poor understanding of sepsis immunopathology represents a crucial barrier to development of locally-effective treatment strategies. We sought to determine inter-individual immunologic heterogeneity among adults hospitalized with sepsis in a sub-Saharan African setting, and characterize associations between immune subtypes, infecting pathogens, and clinical outcomes. 

METHODS: Among a prospective observational cohort of 288 adults hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we applied machine learning methods to 14 soluble host immune mediators, reflective of key domains of sepsis immunopathology (innate and adaptive immune activation, endothelial dysfunction, fibrinolysis), to identify immune subtypes in randomly-split discovery (N = 201) and internal validation (N = 87) sub-cohorts. In parallel, we applied similar methods to whole-blood RNA-sequencing data from a consecutive subset of patients (N = 128) to identify transcriptional subtypes, which we characterized using biological pathway and immune cell-type deconvolution analyses. 

RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering consistently identified two immune subtypes defined by differential activation of pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immune pathways, with transcriptional evidence of concomitant CD56(-)/CD16( +) NK-cell expansion, T-cell exhaustion, and oxidative-stress and hypoxia-induced metabolic and cell-cycle reprogramming in the hyperinflammatory subtype. Immune subtypes defined by greater pro-inflammatory immune activation, T-cell exhaustion, and metabolic reprogramming were consistently associated with a high-prevalence of severe and often disseminated HIV-associated tuberculosis, as well as more extensive organ dysfunction, worse functional outcomes, and higher 30-day mortality. 

CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight unique host- and pathogen-driven features of sepsis immunopathology in sub-Saharan Africa, including the importance of severe HIV-associated tuberculosis, and reinforce the need to develop more biologically-informed treatment strategies in the region, particularly those incorporating immunomodulation.

##中文标题- 宿主反应多维分析揭示乌干达脓毒症成人中的预后和病原体驱动免疫亚型

**摘要**

背景：败血症的全球负担集中在撒哈拉以南非洲地区，严重感染不成比例地影响年轻的HIV感染成人，高负荷病原体是独特的。在这种情况下，对败血症免疫病理学的理解不足是制定局部有效治疗策略的关键障碍。我们试图确定在撒哈拉以南非洲地区因败血症住院的成人中个体间免疫异质性，并描述免疫亚型、感染病原体和临床结局之间的相关性。

方法：在一项对288名乌干达疑似脓毒症住院成人患者进行的前瞻性观察性队列研究中，我们对14种可溶性宿主免疫介质应用机器学习方法，反映脓毒症免疫病理学的关键结构域（固有和适应性免疫激活、内皮功能障碍、纤溶），确定随机拆分发现(N = 201)和内部验证(N = 87)子队列中的免疫亚型。同时，我们应用类似于连续患者子集(N = 128)全血RNA-测序数据的方法来识别转录亚型，我们使用生物学途径和免疫细胞型去卷积分析来表征转录亚型。

结果：非监督聚类一致地确定了由促炎性先天性免疫和适应性免疫通路的不同激活定义的两种免疫亚型，同时存在CD56(-)/CD16(+)NK细胞扩增、T细胞耗竭、转录证据。以及氧化应激和缺氧诱导的高炎症亚型的代谢和细胞周期重编程。以更大的促炎性免疫激活、T细胞耗竭和代谢重编程定义的免疫亚型与重度和通常播散性HIV相关结核病的高患病率，以及更广泛的器官功能障碍、更差的功能结局和更高的30天死亡率一致。

结论：我们的结果强调了撒哈拉以南非洲败血症免疫病理学的独特宿主和病原体驱动特征，包括重度HIV相关结核病的重要性，并强调需要在该地区开发更多生物学知情的治疗策略，尤其是纳入免疫调节的策略。

## Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19 and influenza H1N1 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicenter retrospective cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become an established rescue therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in several etiologies including influenza A H1N1 pneumonia. The benefit of receiving ECMO in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still uncertain. The aim of this analysis was to compare the outcome of patients who received veno-venous ECMO for COVID-19 and Influenza A H1N1 associated ARDS. 

METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including adults with ARDS, receiving ECMO for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 pneumonia between 2009 and 2021 in seven Italian ICU. The primary outcome was any-cause mortality at 60 days after ECMO initiation. We used a multivariable Cox model to estimate the difference in mortality accounting for patients' characteristics and treatment factors before ECMO was started. Secondary outcomes were mortality at 90 days, ICU and hospital length of stay and ECMO associated complications. 

RESULTS: Data from 308 patients with COVID-19 (N = 146) and H1N1 (N = 162) associated ARDS who had received ECMO support were included. The estimated cumulative mortality at 60 days after initiating ECMO was higher in COVID-19 (46%) than H1N1 (27%) patients (hazard ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.17-2.46). When adjusting for confounders, specifically age and hospital length of stay before ECMO support, the hazard ratio decreased to 1.39, 95% CI 0.78-2.47. ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of ECMO and invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO-associated hemorrhagic complications were higher in COVID-19 than H1N1 patients. 

CONCLUSION: In patients with ARDS who received ECMO, the observed unadjusted 60-day mortality was higher in cases of COVID-19 than H1N1 pneumonia. This difference in mortality was not significant after multivariable adjustment; older age and longer hospital length of stay before ECMO emerged as important covariates that could explain the observed difference.

##中文标题- 体外膜肺氧合治疗COVID-19和H1N1流感相关急性呼吸窘迫综合征：一项多中心回顾性队列研究

**摘要**

背景：体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)已成为包括甲型H1N1流感肺炎在内的多种病因导致的重度急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)的一种成熟抢救治疗方法。2019年(COVID-19)，接受ECMO治疗冠状病毒病的获益仍不确定。本分析的目的是比较接受静脉-静脉ECMO治疗COVID-19和甲型H1N1流感相关ARDS患者的结局。

方法：这是一项多中心回顾性队列研究，包括2009年至2021年间在7家意大利ICU接受ECMO治疗COVID-19和甲型H1N1流感肺炎的ARDS成人患者。主要结局为ECMO启动后60天的全因死亡率。我们使用了多变量Cox模型来估计ECMO开始前考虑患者特征和治疗因素的死亡率差异。次要结局为90天死亡率、ICU和住院时间以及ECMO相关并发症。

结果：纳入308例接受ECMO支持的COVID-19(N = 146)和H1N1(N = 162)相关ARDS患者的数据。COVID-19(46%)启动ECMO后60天的估计累积死亡率高于H1N1(27%)患者（风险比1.76，95%CI 1.17-2.46）。当校正混杂因素，特别是年龄和ECMO支持前的住院时间时，风险比下降至1.39，95%CI 0.78-2.47。COVID-19患者的ICU和住院时间、ECMO和有创机械通气的持续时间以及ECMO相关出血并发症均高于H1N1患者。

结论：在接受ECMO的ARDS患者中，COVID-19病例中观察到的未调整60天死亡率高于H1N1肺炎。多变量调整后，这种死亡率差异不显著；ECMO前年龄较大和住院时间较长是可以解释观察到差异的重要协变量。

## Endotheliopathy is associated with slower liberation from mechanical ventilation: a cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Endotheliopathy is suggested as pivotal pathophysiology of sepsis and trauma-associated organ failure, but its role in acute respiratory failure is not yet determined. We investigated if endotheliopathy biomarkers at ICU admission are associated with illness severity and clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. 

METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-center cohort study including 459 mechanically ventilated adults at ICU admission. Plasma levels of three endotheliopathy biomarkers were measured at ICU admission: Syndecan-1, soluble Thrombomodulin (sTM), and Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1). The primary outcome was the rate of liberation from mechanical ventilation, which is presented together with the rate of the competing risk of death while still on mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratios on admission and on last measurement in patients dying within five days, and 30-day all-cause mortality. The primary outcome and 30-day all-cause mortality were analyzed using Cox regression, controlled for gender, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, septic shock, heart failure, PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio at admission, respiratory infection, acute kidney injury, and bilirubin. PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratios were analyzed using linear regression, controlled for age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, and shock. 

RESULTS: Patients with high sTM were liberated from mechanical ventilation at a lower rate (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, for an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.93, p = 0.01). Patients with high PECAM-1 were liberated from mechanical ventilation at a lower rate, but only during the first 5 days (adjusted HR 0.72, for an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile, 95% CI 0.58-0.9, p < 0.01). High levels of Syndecan-1 and PECAM-1 were associated with a higher rate of death while still on mechanical ventilation. sTM and PECAM-1 were negatively associated with PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio at ICU admission and no biomarker was associated with last measured PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio. High levels of all biomarkers were associated with higher 30-day all-cause mortality. 

CONCLUSION: In acute respiratory failure, endotheliopathy biomarkers are associated with lower rates of liberation from mechanical ventilation, hypoxemia at ICU admission, and 30-day all-cause mortality.

##中文标题- 内皮病变与机械通气减慢有关：一项队列研究

**摘要**

背景：内皮病变被认为是败血症和创伤相关器官衰竭的关键病理生理学，但其在急性呼吸衰竭中的作用尚未确定。我们研究了在需要机械通气的急性呼吸衰竭患者中，入住ICU时的内皮病变生物标志物是否与疾病严重程度和临床结局相关。

方法：我们进行了一项前瞻性单中心队列研究，包括459例入住ICU时机械通气的成人。在入住ICU时测量三种内皮病变生物标志物的血浆水平：Syndecan-1、可溶性血栓调节蛋白(sTM)和血小板内皮细胞粘附分子-1(PECAM-1)。主要结局是脱离机械通气的比率，与仍接受机械通气时竞争死亡风险的比率一起列出。次要结局为入院时PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值、5天内死亡患者最后一次测量值和30天全因死亡率。主要结局和30天全因死亡率采用Cox回归进行分析，控制性别、年龄、慢性阻塞性肺疾病、感染性休克、心力衰竭、入院时PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值、呼吸道感染、急性肾损伤和胆红素。采用线性回归分析PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值，控制年龄、慢性阻塞性肺疾病、呼吸道感染和休克。

结果：高sTM患者脱离机械通气的比率较低（调整后的风险比(HR)为0.71，从第25百分位数增加至第75百分位数，95%置信区间(CI)为0.54-0.93，p = 0.01）。高PECAM-1患者以较低的速率从机械通气中解放出来，但仅在前5天（校正HR 0.72，从第25百分位数增加至第75百分位数，95%CI 0.58-0.9，p < 0.01）。高水平的Syndecan-1和PECAM-1与仍在接受机械通气时的高死亡率相关。sTM和PECAM-1与入住ICU时的PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值呈负相关，没有生物标志物与最后一次测量的PaO(2)/FiO(2)比值相关。所有生物标志物的高水平与30天全因死亡率较高相关。

结论：在急性呼吸衰竭中，内皮病生物标志物与较低的机械通气释放率、ICU入院时的低氧血症和30天全因死亡率相关。

## Timing of inspiratory muscle activity detected from airway pressure and flow during pressure support ventilation: the waveform method

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Whether respiratory efforts and their timing can be reliably detected during pressure support ventilation using standard ventilator waveforms is unclear. This would give the opportunity to assess and improve patient-ventilator interaction without the need of special equipment. 

METHODS: In 16 patients under invasive pressure support ventilation, flow and pressure waveforms were obtained from proximal sensors and analyzed by three trained physicians and one resident to assess patient's spontaneous activity. A systematic method (the waveform method) based on explicit rules was adopted. Esophageal pressure tracings were analyzed independently and used as reference. Breaths were classified as assisted or auto-triggered, double-triggered or ineffective. For assisted breaths, trigger delay, early and late cycling (minor asynchronies) were diagnosed. The percentage of breaths with major asynchronies (asynchrony index) and total asynchrony time were computed. 

RESULTS: Out of 4426 analyzed breaths, 94.1% (70.4-99.4) were assisted, 0.0% (0.0-0.2) auto-triggered and 5.8% (0.4-29.6) ineffective. Asynchrony index was 5.9% (0.6-29.6). Total asynchrony time represented 22.4% (16.3-30.1) of recording time and was mainly due to minor asynchronies. Applying the waveform method resulted in an inter-operator agreement of 0.99 (0.98-0.99); 99.5% of efforts were detected on waveforms and agreement with the reference in detecting major asynchronies was 0.99 (0.98-0.99). Timing of respiratory efforts was accurately detected on waveforms: AUC for trigger delay, cycling delay and early cycling was 0.865 (0.853-0.876), 0.903 (0.892-0.914) and 0.983 (0.970-0.991), respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator waveforms can be used alone to reliably assess patient's spontaneous activity and patient-ventilator interaction provided that a systematic method is adopted.

##中文标题- 压力支持通气时从气道压力和流量检测吸气肌活动的时机：波形法

**摘要**

背景：使用标准呼吸机波形在压力支持通气期间能否可靠地检测呼吸努力及其时间尚不清楚。这将有机会在不需要特殊设备的情况下评估和改善患者与呼吸机的相互作用。

方法：在16例有创压力支持通气的患者中，从近端传感器获得流量和压力波形，并由3名经过培训的医生和1名住院医师进行分析，以评估患者的自主活动。采用基于明确规则的系统化方法（波形法）。独立分析食管压力描记图并用作参考。呼吸分类为辅助或自动触发、双重触发或无效。对于辅助呼吸，诊断为触发延迟、早期和晚期循环（轻微不同步）。计算了主要不同步（不同步指数）的呼吸百分比和总不同步时间。

结果：在分析的4426次呼吸中，94.1%(70.4-99.4)为辅助呼吸，0.0%(0.0-0.2)为自动触发呼吸，5.8%(0.4-29.6)为无效呼吸。不同步指数为5.9%(0.6-29.6)。总不同步时间占记录时间的22.4%(16.3-30.1)，主要是由于轻微不同步。应用波形法得到的操作员间一致性为0.99(0.98-0.99)；在波形上检测到99.5%的努力，在检测主要不同步时与参考一致率为0.99(0.98-0.99)。在波形上准确检测呼吸做功的时间：触发延迟、循环延迟和早期循环的AUC分别为0.865(0.853-0.876)、0.903(0.892-0.914)和0.983(0.970-0.991)。

结论：如果采用系统方法，呼吸机波形可单独用于可靠评估患者的自主活动和患者-呼吸机相互作用。

## Corticosteroids as risk factor for COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in intensive care patients

**Abstract**

PURPOSE: Corticosteroids, in particular dexamethasone, are one of the primary treatment options for critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, there are a growing number of cases that involve COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), and it is unclear whether dexamethasone represents a risk factor for CAPA. Our aim was to investigate a possible association of the recommended dexamethasone therapy with a risk of CAPA. 

METHODS: We performed a study based on a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated in 2020 in our 13 intensive care units at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We used ECMM/ISHM criteria for the CAPA diagnosis and performed univariate and multivariable analyses of clinical parameters to identify risk factors that could result in a diagnosis of CAPA. 

RESULTS: Altogether, among the n = 522 intensive care patients analyzed, n = 47 (9%) patients developed CAPA. CAPA patients had a higher simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) (64 vs. 53, p < 0.001) and higher levels of IL-6 (1,005 vs. 461, p < 0.008). They more often had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (60% vs. 41%, p = 0.024), renal replacement therapy (60% vs. 41%, p = 0.024), and they were more likely to die (64% vs. 48%, p = 0.049). The multivariable analysis showed dexamethasone (OR 3.110, CI95 1.112-8.697) and SAPS (OR 1.063, CI95 1.028-1.098) to be independent risk factors for CAPA. 

CONCLUSION: In our study, dexamethasone therapy as recommended for COVID-19 was associated with a significant three times increase in the risk of CAPA.

##中文标题- 皮质类固醇是重症监护患者中COVID-19相关肺曲霉病的风险因素

**摘要**

皮质类固醇，尤其是地塞米松，是COVID-19重症患者的主要治疗选择之一。然而，越来越多的病例涉及COVID-19相关性肺曲霉病(CAPA)，尚不清楚地塞米松是否代表CAPA的风险因素。我们的目的是研究推荐的地塞米松治疗与CAPA风险之间的可能关联。

方法：我们进行了一项基于2020年在柏林CharitéUniversitätsmedizin的13家重症监护室接受治疗的COVID-19患者队列的研究。我们使用了ECMM/ISHM标准进行CAPA诊断，并对临床参数进行了单变量和多变量分析，以确定可能导致CAPA诊断的风险因素。

结果：总体而言，在分析的522例重症监护患者中，47例(9%)患者发生了CAPA。CAPA患者的简化急性生理评分(SAPS)(64 vs. 53，p < 0.001)和IL-6水平(1,005 vs. 461，p < 0.008)较高。他们更常发生重度急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)(60%vs. 41%，p = 0.024)、肾脏替代治疗(60%vs. 41%，p = 0.024)，他们更有可能死亡(64%vs. 48%，p = 0.049)。多变量分析显示地塞米松(OR 3.110，CI 95 1.112-8.697)和SAPS(OR 1.063，CI 95 1.028-1.098)是CAPA的独立风险因素。

结论：在我们的研究中，推荐用于COVID-19的地塞米松治疗与CAPA风险显著增加3倍相关。

## Immune effects of PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α-regulated glycolysis in polymorphonuclear neutrophils during sepsis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Effective removal of pathogenic bacteria is key to improving the prognosis of sepsis. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the most important components of innate cellular immunity and play vital roles in clearing pathogenic bacteria. However, the metabolic characteristics and immunomodulatory pathways of PMNs during sepsis have not been investigated. In the present study, we explored the immune metabolism characteristics of PMNs and the mechanism by which neutrophilic glycolysis is regulated during sepsis. 

METHODS: Metabolomics analysis was performed on PMNs isolated from 14 septic patients, 26 patients with acute appendicitis, and 19 healthy volunteers. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the PMNs isolated from the healthy volunteers and the patients with sepsis to assess glycolysis and investigate its mechanism. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate the neutrophils isolated from the healthy volunteers at different time intervals to build an LPS-tolerant model. Chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lactate production, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were evaluated. 

RESULTS: Transcriptomics showed significant changes in glycolysis and the mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway during sepsis. Metabolomics revealed that the Warburg effect was significantly altered in the patients with sepsis. We discovered that glycolysis regulated PMNs' chemotaxis and phagocytosis functions during sepsis. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) downregulation was a key factor in the inhibition of glycolysis in PMNs. This study confirmed that the PI3K/Akt-HIF-1α pathway was involved in the LDHA expression level and also influenced PMNs' chemotaxis and phagocytosis functions. 

CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of glycolysis contributed to neutrophil immunosuppression during sepsis and might be controlled by PI3K/Akt-HIF-1α pathway-mediated LDHA downregulation. Our study provides a scientific theoretical basis for the management and treatment of patients with sepsis and promotes to identify therapeutic target for the improvement of immune function in sepsis.

##中文标题- 败血症期间多形核中性粒细胞中PI3K/Akt/dms1α调节的糖酵解的免疫效应

**摘要**

背景：有效清除病原菌是改善脓毒症预后的关键。多形核中性粒细胞(PMN)是固有细胞免疫最重要的组成部分，在清除致病菌中发挥重要作用。但是，尚未研究败血症期间PMN的代谢特征和免疫调节途径。在本研究中，我们探索了PMN的免疫代谢特征和败血症期间调节中性粒细胞糖酵解的机制。

方法：对14例败血症患者、26例急性阑尾炎患者和19例健康志愿者分离的PMN进行代谢组学分析。对分离自健康志愿者和败血症患者的PMN进行转录组分析，评估糖酵解并探讨其机制。采用脂多糖(LPS)刺激不同时间间隔的健康志愿者分离的中性粒细胞，构建LPS耐受模型。评价了趋化作用、吞噬作用、乳酸盐产量、耗氧量(OCR)和细胞外酸化率(ECAR)。

结果：在脓毒症过程中，转录基因组学显示糖酵解和mTOR/HIF-1α信号通路发生显著变化。代谢组学显示脓毒症患者的Warburg效应显著改变。我们发现败血症时糖酵解调节PMN的趋化和吞噬作用。乳酸脱氢酶A(LDHA)下调是抑制PMN糖酵解的关键因素。本研究证实PI3K/Akt-HIF-1α通路参与LDHA表达水平，也影响PMN的趋化和吞噬作用功能。

结论：糖酵解抑制有助于败血症期间的中性粒细胞免疫抑制，并且可能受到PI3K/Akt-HIF-1α通路介导的LDHA下调的控制。本研究为脓毒血症患者的管理和治疗提供了科学的理论依据，并促进确定改善脓毒血症免疫功能的治疗靶点。

## Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on lung ultrasound patterns and their correlation with intracranial pressure in mechanically ventilated brain injured patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on lung ultrasound (LUS) patterns, and their relationship with intracranial pressure (ICP) in brain injured patients have not been completely clarified. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effect of two levels of PEEP (5 and 15 cmH(2)O) on global (LUStot) and regional (anterior, lateral, and posterior areas) LUS scores and their correlation with changes of invasive ICP. Secondary aims included: the evaluation of the effect of PEEP on respiratory mechanics, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) and hemodynamics; the correlation between changes in ICP and LUS as well as respiratory parameters; the identification of factors at baseline as potential predictors of ICP response to higher PEEP. 

METHODS: Prospective, observational study including adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP. Total and regional LUS scores, ICP, respiratory mechanics, and arterial blood gases values were analyzed at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH(2)O. 

RESULTS: Thirty patients were included; 19 of them (63.3%) were male, with median age of 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 66.7-76.0]. PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O reduced LUS score in the posterior regions (LUSp, median value from 7 [5-8] to 4.5 [3.7-6], p = 0.002). Changes in ICP were significantly correlated with changes in LUStot (rho = 0.631, p = 0.0002), LUSp (rho = 0.663, p < 0.0001), respiratory system compliance (rho = - 0.599, p < 0.0001), mean arterial pressure (rho = - 0.833, p < 0.0001) and PaCO(2) (rho = 0.819, p < 0.0001). Baseline LUStot score predicted the increase of ICP with PEEP. 

CONCLUSIONS: LUS-together with the evaluation of respiratory and clinical variables-can assist the clinicians in the bedside assessment and prediction of the effect of PEEP on ICP in patients with acute brain injury.

##中文标题- 呼吸末正压通气对机械通气脑损伤患者肺部超声改变及其与颅内压的关系

**摘要**

背景：呼气末正压(PEEP)对脑损伤患者肺部超声(LUS)模式的影响及其与颅内压(ICP)的关系尚未完全明确。本研究的主要目的是评估两个水平的PEEP（5和15 cmh2）O）对整体(LUStot)和区域（前、侧和后区域）LUS评分的影响，及其与有创ICP变化的相关性。次要目的包括：评价PEEP对呼吸力学、动脉血二氧化碳分压(PaCO(2))和血流动力学的影响；ICP和LUS以及呼吸参数变化之间的相关性；确定基线因素作为ICP对较高PEEP反应的潜在预测因素。

方法：前瞻性、观察性研究，包括需要侵入性ICP的急性脑损伤成人机械通气患者。在PEEP 5和15 cmH(2)O下分析LUS总评分和局部评分、ICP、呼吸力学和动脉血气值。

结果：纳入30例患者；其中19例(63.3%)为男性，中位年龄为65岁[四分位距(IQR)= 66.7-76.0]。PEEP从5 cmh2到15 cmh2 O降低了后部区域的LUS评分（LUSp，中位值从7[5-8]至4.5[3.7-6]，p = 0.002）。ICP变化与LUStot(rho = 0.631，p = 0.0002)、LUSp(rho = 0.663，p < 0.0001)、呼吸系统顺应性(rho =-0.599，p < 0.0001)、平均动脉压(rho =-0.833，p < 0.0001)和PaCO(2)(rho = 0.819，p < 0.0001)变化显著相关。基线LUStot评分预测PEEP使ICP升高。

结论：LUS-结合呼吸和临床变量评估-可协助临床医生床旁评估和预测PEEP对急性脑损伤患者ICP的影响。

## Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Intravenous vitamin C administration in septic shock may have a sparing effect on vasopressor requirements, and vitamin C's enzyme cofactor functions provide a mechanistic rationale. Our study aimed to determine the effect of intravenous vitamin C administration on vasopressor requirements and other outcomes in patients with septic shock. 

METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial in 40 patients with septic shock who were randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous vitamin C (at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h) or placebo (intravenous 5% dextrose) for up to 96 h, or until death or discharge. The primary outcome was intravenous vasopressor requirements (dose and duration), and secondary outcomes included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and mortality. In addition, blood samples were collected to determine vitamin C kinetics and inflammatory marker concentrations. 

RESULTS: Median plasma vitamin C concentrations were deficient at baseline (9.2 [4.4, 12] µmol/L) and increased to 408 (227, 560) µmol/L following 72 h of intervention. The mean duration of intravenous vasopressor infusion in the vitamin C group was 48 (95% CI 35-62) hours and in the placebo group was 54 (95% CI 41-62) hours (p = 0.52). The dose of vasopressor delivered over time was comparable between the two groups, as were SOFA scores (p > 0.05). The median ICU length of stay in the intervention group was 3.8 (2.2, 9.8) days versus 7.1 (3.1, 20) days in the placebo group (p = 0.12). The median hospital length of stay for the vitamin C group was 18 (11, 35) days versus 22 (10, 52) days for the placebo group (p = 0.65). Mortality was comparable between the two groups (p > 0.05). Of the inflammatory markers, neutrophil counts were elevated in the vitamin C group relative to placebo by 72 h (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase concentrations were elevated at baseline, however, the two groups were comparable over time (p > 0.05). 

CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study indicated that intravenous vitamin C did not provide significant decreases in the mean dose or duration of vasopressor infusion. Further research that takes into account the potential impact of intervention timing, dose and duration, and location of trial, may provide more definitive evidence.

##中文标题- 在感染性休克患者中静脉给予维生素C：一项初步随机对照试验

**摘要**

背景：在脓毒性休克中静脉给予维生素C可能对血管加压素的需求具有保护作用，维生素C的酶辅因子功能提供了机制依据。我们的研究旨在确定静脉注射维生素C对感染性休克患者血管加压素需求和其他结局的影响。

方法：这是一项在40例感染性休克患者中进行的双盲、随机、安慰剂对照试验，患者随机(1:1)接受静脉维生素C（剂量为25 mg/kg体重，每6h一次）或安慰剂（静脉给予5%葡萄糖）最长96h，或直至死亡或出院。主要结局是静脉内升压药需求（剂量和持续时间），次要结局包括序贯器官衰竭评估(SOFA)评分、重症监护室(ICU)和住院时间以及死亡率。此外，采集血样以测定维生素C动力学和炎症标志物浓度。

结果：基线时中位血浆维生素C浓度不足(9.2[4.4，12]µmol/L)，干预72h后增加至408(227，560)µmol/L。维生素C组静脉输注血管加压药的平均持续时间为48(95%CI 35-62)小时，安慰剂组为54(95%CI 41-62)小时(p = 0.52)。随着时间推移，两组之间的血管加压素给药剂量相当，SOFA评分也是如此(p > 0.05)。干预组的中位ICU住院时间为3.8(2.2，9.8)天，安慰剂组为7.1(3.1，20)天(p = 0.12)。维生素C组的中位住院时间为18(11，35)天，安慰剂组为22(10，52)天(p = 0.65)。两组的死亡率相当(p > 0.05)。到72h时，维生素C组的炎症标志物中性粒细胞计数相对于安慰剂组升高(p = 0.01)。基线时C反应蛋白和髓过氧化物酶浓度升高，但是两组随时间的变化相当(p > 0.05)。

结论：我们的初探性研究表明，静脉输注维生素C并未导致血管加压药的平均剂量或持续时间显著降低。考虑干预时间、剂量和持续时间以及试验地点的潜在影响的进一步研究可能提供更明确的证据。

## Vitamin C improves microvascular reactivity and peripheral tissue perfusion in septic shock patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Vitamin C has potential protective effects through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of vitamin C supplementation on microvascular function and peripheral tissue perfusion in human sepsis remains unknown. We aimed to determine vitamin C effect on microvascular endothelial dysfunction and peripheral tissue perfusion in septic shock patients. 

METHODS: Patients with septic shock were prospectively included after initial resuscitation. Bedside peripheral tissue perfusion and skin microvascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine iontophoresis in the forearm area were measured before and 1 h after intravenous vitamin C supplementation (40 mg/kg). Norepinephrine dose was not modified during the studied period. 

RESULTS: We included 30 patients with septic shock. SOFA score was 11 [8-14], SAPS II was 66 [54-79], and in-hospital mortality was 33%. Half of these patients had vitamin C deficiency at inclusion. Vitamin C supplementation strongly improved microvascular reactivity (AUC 2263 [430-4246] vs 5362 [1744-10585] UI, p = 0.0004). In addition, vitamin C supplementation improved mottling score (p = 0.06), finger-tip (p = 0.0003) and knee capillary refill time (3.7 [2.6-5.5] vs 2.9 [1.9-4.7] s, p < 0.0001), as well as and central-to-periphery temperature gradient (6.1 [4.9-7.4] vs 4.6 [3.4-7.0] °C, p < 0.0001). The beneficial effects of vitamin C were observed both in patients with or without vitamin C deficiency. 

CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients being resuscitated, vitamin C supplementation improved peripheral tissue perfusion and microvascular reactivity whatever plasma levels of vitamin C. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04778605 registered 26 January 2021.

##中文标题- 维生素C改善感染性休克患者微血管反应性和外周组织灌注

**摘要**

背景：维生素C通过抗氧化和抗炎特性具有潜在的保护作用。然而，维生素C补充对人类脓毒症微血管功能和外周组织灌注的影响仍不清楚。我们旨在确定维生素C对感染性休克患者微血管内皮功能障碍和外周组织灌注的影响。

方法：前瞻性纳入初始复苏后的感染性休克患者。在静脉补充维生素C(40 mg/kg)之前和之后1 h，测量了床旁外周组织灌注和前臂区域对乙酰胆碱离子导入应答的皮肤微血管反应性。在研究期间，未改变去甲肾上腺素的剂量。

结果：我们纳入了30例感染性休克患者。SOFA评分为11[8-14]，SAPS II为66[54-79]，住院死亡率为33%。这些患者中有一半在入选时存在维生素C缺乏。补充维生素C显著改善微血管反应性（AUC 2263[430-4246]对比5362[1744-10585]UI，p = 0.0004）。此外，补充维生素C改善了色斑评分(p = 0.06)、指尖(p = 0.0003)和膝关节毛细血管再充盈时间(3.7[2.6-5.5]vs 2.9[1.9-4.7]s，p < 0.0001)以及中心-外周温度梯度(6.1[4.9-7.4]vs 4.6[3.4-7.0]°C，p < 0.0001)。在有或无维生素C缺乏的患者中均观察到维生素C的有益作用。

结论：在复苏的感染性休克患者中，无论血浆维生素C水平如何，补充维生素C改善了外周组织灌注和微血管反应性。ClinicalTrials.gov识别码：NCT04778605注册日期：2021年1月26日。

## Association between hospital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China: a secondary analysis of the National Clinical Improvement System Data in 2019

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Hospital and ICU structural factors are key factors affecting the quality of care as well as ICU patient outcomes. However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019. 

METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical Improvement System Data that reports ICU information in China. Data collection consisted of a) information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffing, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes. 

RESULTS: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP, CRBSI, and CAUTI were 5.58 (1.55, 11.67) per 1000 ventilator days, 0.63 (0, 2.01) per 1000 catheter days, and 1.42 (0.37, 3.40) per 1000 catheter days, respectively. Mortality was significantly lower in public hospitals (β =  - 0.018 (- 0.031, - 0.005), p = 0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (β =  - 0.027 (- 0.034, -0.019), p < 0.001) and higher in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0.5:1 (β = 0.009 (0.001, 0.017), p = 0.027). The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (β =  - 0.036 (- 0.054, - 0.018), p < 0.001). The incidence of CRBSIs was lower in public hospitals (β =  - 0.008 (- 0.014, - 0.002), p = 0.011) and higher in secondary hospitals (β = 0.005 (0.001, 0.009), p = 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTIs was higher in secondary hospitals (β = 0.010 (0.002, 0.018), p = 0.015). 

CONCLUSION: This study highlights the association between specific ICU structural factors and patient outcomes. Modifying structural factors is a potential opportunity that could improve patient outcomes in ICUs.

##中文标题- 中国医院和ICU结构因素与患者结局的相关性：2019年全国临床改进系统数据的二次分析

**摘要**

背景：医院和ICU结构因素是影响护理质量以及ICU患者结局的关键因素。然而，来自中国的数据很少。本研究旨在研究2019年期间中国患者结局差异与医院和ICU结构变量差异之间的相关性。

方法：这是一项多中心观察性研究。使用报告中国ICU信息的国家临床改进系统数据收集了总计2820家医院的数据。数据收集包括a）医院和ICU结构因素的信息，包括医院类型、床位数量、人员配备等，和b）ICU患者结局，包括死亡率以及呼吸机相关性肺炎(VAP)、导管相关血流感染(CRBSI)的发生率，导管相关尿路感染(CAUTI)。使用广义线性混合模型分析医院和ICU结构因素与患者结局之间的相关性。

结果：ICU患者中位死亡率为8.02%(3.78%，14.35%)，VAP、CRBSI和CAUTI的发生率分别为5.58(1.55，11.67)/1000呼吸机日、0.63(0，2.01)/1000导管日和1.42(0.37，3.40)/1000导管日。公立医院死亡率显著降低（β =  -0.018(-0.031，-0.005)，p = 0.006），ICU/病床比例超过2%的医院（β =  -0.027(-0.034，-0.019)，p < 0.001），在病床与护士比率超过0.5:1的医院中更高(β = 0.009(0.001，0.017)，p = 0.027)。公立医院VAP发生率较低（β =  - 0.036 (- 0.054, - 0.018), p < 0.001).公立医院CRBSIs发生率较低（β =  -0.008(-0.014，-0.002)，p = 0.011），在二级医院中较高(β = 0.005(0.001，0.009)，p = 0.010)，而CAUTI在二级医院中较高(β = 0.010(0.002，0.018)，p = 0.015)。

结论：本研究强调了特定ICU结构因素与患者结局之间的相关性。修改结构因素是可能改善ICU患者结局的一个潜在机会。

## Omega-6 sparing effects of parenteral lipid emulsions-an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Parenteral lipid emulsions in critical care are traditionally based on soybean oil (SO) and rich in pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids (FAs). Parenteral nutrition (PN) strategies with the aim of reducing omega-6 FAs may potentially decrease the morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. 

METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL was conducted to identify all randomized controlled trials in critically ill patients published from inception to June 2021, which investigated clinical omega-6 sparing effects. Two independent reviewers extracted bias risk, treatment details, patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. Random effect meta-analysis was performed. 

RESULTS: 1054 studies were identified in our electronic search, 136 trials were assessed for eligibility and 26 trials with 1733 critically ill patients were included. The median methodologic score was 9 out of 14 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 7, 10). Omega-6 FA sparing PN in comparison with traditional lipid emulsions did not decrease overall mortality (20 studies; risk ratio [RR] 0.91; 95% CI 0.76, 1.10; p = 0.34) but hospital length of stay was substantially reduced (6 studies; weighted mean difference [WMD] - 6.88; 95% CI - 11.27,  - 2.49; p = 0.002). Among the different lipid emulsions, fish oil (FO) containing PN reduced the length of intensive care (8 studies; WMD - 3.53; 95% CI - 6.16,  - 0.90; p = 0.009) and rate of infectious complications (4 studies; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44, 0.95; p = 0.03). When FO was administered as a stand-alone medication outside PN, potential mortality benefits were observed compared to standard care. 

CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings highlight distinctive omega-6 sparing effects attributed to PN. Among the different lipid emulsions, FO in combination with PN or as a stand-alone treatment may have the greatest clinical impact.

##中文标题- 肠外脂肪乳剂对ω-6的节制作用-一项对危重患者临床结局的更新系统审查和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：在重症监护中，肠外脂肪乳剂传统上以大豆油(SO)为基础，并富含促炎性ω-6脂肪酸(FA)。旨在减少ω-6脂肪酸的肠外营养(PN)策略可能会降低重症患者的发病率和死亡率。

方法：对MEDLINE、EMBASE、CINAHL和CENTRAL进行了系统检索，以确定自开始至2021年6月发表的所有在危重患者中进行的随机化对照试验，研究了临床omega-6保留效应。两名独立审查员提取了偏倚风险、治疗详情、患者特征和临床结局。进行随机效应荟萃分析。

结果：我们的电子检索确定了1054项研究，136项试验被评估合格性，纳入26项试验，1733例重症患者。14分中的中位方法评分为9分（95%置信区间[CI]7，10）。与传统脂肪乳剂相比，Omega-6 FA保留PN未降低总死亡率（20项研究；风险比[RR]0.91；95%CI 0.76，1.10；p = 0.34），但住院时间显著缩短（6项研究；加权平均差异[WMD]-6.88；95%CI-11.27，  - 2.49; p = 0.002).在不同脂肪乳剂中，含PN的鱼油(FO)缩短了重症监护时间（8项研究；WMD-3.53；95%CI-6.16，  -0.90；p = 0.009）和感染并发症发生率（4项研究；RR 0.65；95%CI 0.44，0.95；p = 0.03）。当FO作为PN以外的独立药物给药时，与标准治疗相比，观察到潜在的死亡获益。

结论：总体而言，这些结果强调了PN对omega-6的独特保护作用。在不同的脂肪乳剂中，FO联合PN或作为独立治疗可能具有最大的临床影响。

##中文标题- 蛋白C作为成人脓毒症生物标志物的预后效用：系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：脓毒症是宿主对感染的应答失调，引发异常促凝和促炎性宿主反应。早期疾病干预的局限性突出了对有效诊断和预后生物标志物的需求。蛋白C作为抗凝和抗炎分子的作用使其成为败血症生物标志物研究的一个有吸引力的靶标。这项荟萃分析旨在评估蛋白C(PC)作为成人脓毒症生物标志物的诊断和预后价值。

方法：我们检索了MEDLINE、PubMed、EMBASE、CINAHL和Cochrane Library数据库，时间范围从建库至2021年9月12日。我们纳入了以下前瞻性观察性研究：(1)伴有败血症或疑似败血症的成年患者(> 17)；(2)研究入院24h后测量PC水平；(3)检查PC作为诊断或预后生物标志物的目标。两位作者使用预后研究质量(QUIPS)和诊断研究质量评估-2(QUADAS-2)工具筛选文章并进行偏倚风险(RoB)评估。如果数据充足，则进行荟萃分析，估计患者人群之间的标准化平均差异(SMD)。

结果：纳入12项研究，综合8项进行荟萃分析。汇总分析表明，PC水平降低的证据具有中等确定性，败血症存活者低于非存活者（6项研究，741例患者，SMD = 0.52，95%CI 0.24-0.81，p = 0.0003，I(2)= 55%），无弥散性血管内凝血(DIC)的败血症患者中，PC水平下降幅度低于DIC患者的证据确定性较低（3项研究，644例患者，SMD = 0.97，95%CI 0.62-1.32，p < 0.00001，I(2)= 67%）。由于研究间对照人群的异质性，PC不能作为一种诊断工具进行评价。结论与相关性：我们的综述证实，与非存活者和患有败血症但非弥散性血管内凝血(DIC)的患者相比，败血症存活者的PC水平显著升高。我们的评估受到了纳入研究中高RoB以及作为败血症生物标志物的PC的敏感性和特异性的较差报告的限制。未来的研究需要确定PC的敏感性和特异性，以确定其作为早期败血症识别生物标志物的临床意义。试验注册PROSPERO注册号：CRD42021229786。研究方案发表在BMJ Open上。

## The prognostic utility of protein C as a biomarker for adult sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Sepsis, the dysregulated host response to infection, triggers abnormal pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory host responses. Limitations in early disease intervention highlight the need for effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Protein C's role as an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory molecule makes it an appealing target for sepsis biomarker studies. This meta-analysis aims to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of protein C (PC) as a biomarker for adult sepsis. 

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library from database inception to September 12, 2021. We included prospective observational studies of (1) adult patients (> 17) with sepsis or suspicion of sepsis that; (2) measured PC levels with 24 h of study admission with; and (3) the goal of examining PC as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker. Two authors screened articles and conducted risk of bias (RoB) assessment, using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Quality Assessment in Diagnostic Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tools. If sufficient data were available, meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) between patient populations. 

RESULTS: Twelve studies were included, and 8 were synthesized for meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated moderate certainty of evidence that PC levels were less reduced in sepsis survivors compared to non-survivors (6 studies, 741 patients, SMD = 0.52, 95% CI 0.24-0.81, p = 0.0003, I(2) = 55%), and low certainty of evidence that PC levels were less reduced in septic patients without disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) compared to those with DIC (3 studies, 644 patients, SMD = 0.97, 95% CI 0.62-1.32, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 67%). PC could not be evaluated as a diagnostic tool due to heterogeneous control populations between studies. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our review demonstrates that PC levels were significantly higher in sepsis survivors compared to non-survivors and patients with sepsis but not disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Our evaluation is limited by high RoB in included studies and poor reporting of the sensitivity and specificity of PC as a sepsis biomarker. Future studies are needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of PC to identify its clinical significance as a biomarker for early sepsis recognition. Trial Registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021229786. The study protocol was published in BMJ Open.

## Value of variation of end-tidal carbon dioxide for predicting fluid responsiveness during the passive leg raising test in patients with mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: The ability of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ΔEtCO2) for predicting fluid responsiveness has been extensively studied with conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the value of ΔEtCO2 for predicting fluid responsiveness during the passive leg raising (PLR) test in patients with mechanical ventilation. 

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to November 2021. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated, and the area under the curve (AUROC) was calculated. Q test and I(2) statistics were used for study heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed by Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test. We performed meta-regression analysis for heterogeneity exploration and sensitivity analysis for the publication bias. 

RESULTS: Overall, six studies including 298 patients were included in this review, of whom 149 (50%) were fluid responsive. The cutoff values of ΔEtCO2 in four studies was 5%, one was 5.8% and the other one was an absolute increase 2 mmHg. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with an overall Q = 4.098, I(2) = 51%, and P = 0.064. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the overall population were 0.79 (95% CI 0.72-0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.77-0.96), respectively. The DOR was 35 (95% CI 12-107). The pooled AUROC was 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84). On meta-regression analysis, the number of patients was sources of heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled DOR ranged from 21 to 140 and the pooled AUC ranged from 0.92 to 0.96 when one study was omitted. 

CONCLUSIONS: Though the limited number of studies included and study heterogeneity, our meta-analysis confirmed that the ΔEtCO2 performed moderately in predicting fluid responsiveness during the PLR test in patients with mechanical ventilation.

##中文标题- 潮气末二氧化碳变化在机械通气患者被动抬腿试验中预测液体反应性的价值：一项系统综述和荟萃分析

**摘要**

背景：广泛研究了呼气末二氧化碳(ΔEtCO2)预测液体反应性的能力，结果相互矛盾。该荟萃分析旨在探索ΔEtCO2在预测机械通气患者被动抬腿(PLR)试验期间液体反应的价值。

方法：检索PubMed、Embase和Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials，检索时间截至2021年11月。计算诊断优势比(DOR)、敏感性和特异性。估算汇总受试者工作特征曲线，计算曲线下面积(AUROC)。Q检验和I(2)统计量用于研究异质性，发表偏倚通过Deeks漏斗图不对称性检验进行评估。我们对异质性探索进行了荟萃回归分析，并对发表偏倚进行了敏感性分析。

结果：本综述共纳入6项研究，包括298例患者，其中149例(50%)为液体反应性。4项研究中ΔEtCO2的临界值为5%，1项为5.8%，另1项为绝对升高2 mmHg。评估了研究之间的异质性，总体Q = 4.098，I(2)= 51%，P = 0.064。总人群的汇总灵敏度和特异性分别为0.79(95%CI 0.72-0.85)和0.90(95%CI 0.77-0.96)。DOR为35(95%CI 12-107)。合并AUROC为0.81(95%CI 0.77-0.84)。在荟萃-回归分析中，患者数量是异质性的来源。敏感性分析显示，当一项研究被忽略时，汇总的DOR范围为21至140，汇总的AUC范围为0.92至0.96。

结论：尽管纳入的研究数量有限且研究存在异质性，但我们的荟萃分析证实，ΔEtCO2在预测机械通气患者PLR测试期间的液体反应性方面表现适度。

## Time-to-antibiotics and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Timely administration of antibiotics is one of the most important interventions in reducing mortality in sepsis. However, administering antibiotics within a strict time threshold in all patients suspected with sepsis will require huge amount of effort and resources and may increase the risk of unintentional exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients without infection with its consequences. Thus, controversy still exists on whether clinicians should target different time-to-antibiotics thresholds for patients with sepsis versus septic shock. 

METHODS: This study analyzed prospectively collected data from an ongoing multicenter cohort of patients with sepsis identified in the emergency department. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were compared for in-hospital mortality of patients who had received antibiotics within 1 h to that of those who did not. Spline regression models were used to assess the association of time-to-antibiotics as continuous variables and increasing risk of in-hospital mortality. The differences in the association between time-to-antibiotics and in-hospital mortality were assessed according to the presence of septic shock. 

RESULTS: Overall, 3035 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 601 (19.8%) presented with septic shock, and 774 (25.5%) died. The adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality of patients whose time-to-antibiotics was within 1 h was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.99; p = 0.046). The adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.66 (95% CI 0.44-0.99; p = 0.049) and statistically significant in patients with septic shock, whereas it was 0.85 (95% CI 0.64-1.15; p = 0.300) in patients with sepsis but without shock. Among patients who received antibiotics within 3 h, those with septic shock showed 35% (p = 0.042) increased risk of mortality for every 1-h delay in antibiotics, but no such trend was observed in patients without shock. 

CONCLUSION: Timely administration of antibiotics improved outcomes in patients with septic shock; however, the association between early antibiotic administration and outcome was not as clear in patients with sepsis without shock.

##中文标题- 败血症和感染性休克患者的抗生素使用时间和临床结局：前瞻性、全国多中心队列研究

**摘要**

背景：及时给予抗生素是降低败血症死亡率的最重要干预措施之一。但是，对所有疑似败血症患者在严格的时间阈值内给予抗生素将需要巨大的努力和资源，并且可能增加无感染及其后果的患者意外暴露于广谱抗生素的风险。因此，关于临床医生是否应该针对败血症与感染性休克患者的不同抗生素使用时间阈值仍存在争议。

方法：本研究前瞻性分析了从急诊室确诊为败血症患者的正在进行的多中心队列中收集的数据。比较1h内接受抗生素的患者与未接受抗生素的患者的住院死亡率调整比值比(OR)。使用样条回归模型评估至抗生素时间作为连续变量与增加住院死亡率风险的相关性。根据是否存在感染性休克，评估至抗生素治疗时间与住院死亡率之间相关性的差异。

结果：总体而言，3035例患者纳入分析。其中感染性休克601例(19.8%)，死亡774例(25.5%)。抗生素使用时间在1h内的患者住院死亡率的校正OR为0.78（95%置信区间[CI]0.61-0.99；p = 0.046）。脓毒性休克患者的住院死亡率校正OR为0.66(95%CI 0.44-0.99；p = 0.049)，具有统计学意义，而有脓毒症但无休克的患者为0.85(95%CI 0.64-1.15；p = 0.300)。在3h内接受抗生素治疗的患者中，感染性休克患者抗生素治疗每延迟1h，死亡风险增加35%(p = 0.042)，但未发生休克的患者未观察到这种趋势。

结论：及时给予抗生素改善了感染性休克患者的结局；然而，在无休克的败血症患者中，早期给予抗生素与结局之间的相关性并不明确。

## Impact of time to intubation on mortality and pulmonary sequelae in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study

**Abstract**

QUESTION: We evaluated whether the time between first respiratory support and intubation of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) due to COVID-19 was associated with mortality or pulmonary sequelae. MATERIALS AND 

METHODS: Prospective cohort of critical COVID-19 patients on IMV. Patients were classified as early intubation if they were intubated within the first 48 h from the first respiratory support or delayed intubation if they were intubated later. Surviving patients were evaluated after hospital discharge. 

RESULTS: We included 205 patients (140 with early IMV and 65 with delayed IMV). The median [p(25);p(75)] age was 63 [56.0; 70.0] years, and 74.1% were male. The survival analysis showed a significant increase in the risk of mortality in the delayed group with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.45 (95% CI 1.29-4.65). The continuous predictor time to IMV showed a nonlinear association with the risk of in-hospital mortality. A multivariate mortality model showed that delay of IMV was a factor associated with mortality (HR of 2.40; 95% CI 1.42-4.1). During follow-up, patients in the delayed group showed a worse DLCO (mean difference of  - 10.77 (95% CI - 18.40 to - 3.15), with a greater number of affected lobes (+ 1.51 [95% CI 0.89-2.13]) and a greater TSS (+ 4.35 [95% CI 2.41-6.27]) in the chest CT scan. 

CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required IMV, the delay in intubation from the first respiratory support was associated with an increase in hospital mortality and worse pulmonary sequelae during follow-up.

##中文标题- 在COVID-19重症患者中，插管时间对死亡率和肺部后遗症的影响：前瞻性队列研究

**摘要**

问题：我们评估了因COVID-19接受有创机械通气(IMV)的患者的首次呼吸支持和插管之间的时间是否与死亡率或肺部后遗症相关。材料和

方法：接受IMV的关键COVID-19患者的前瞻性队列。如果患者在首次呼吸支持的前48h内插管，则将其分类为早期插管，如果患者在之后插管，则将其分类为延迟插管。出院后评价存活患者。

结果：我们纳入了205例患者（140例早期IMV和65例延迟IMV）。中位[p(25)；p(75)]年龄为63[56.0；70.0]岁，74.1%为男性。生存分析显示，延迟组的死亡风险显著增加，调整后的风险比(HR)为2.45(95%CI 1.29-4.65)。至IMV时间的连续预测因子显示与住院死亡率风险的非线性相关性。多变量死亡率模型显示，IMV延迟是死亡率相关因素（HR为2.40；95%CI 1.42-4.1）。随访期间，延迟组患者的DLCO更差（平均差异  -10.77（95%CI-18.40至-3.15），胸部CT扫描中受累肺叶数量较多(+ 1.51[95%CI 0.89-2.13])，TSS较高(+ 4.35[95%CI 2.41-6.27])。

结论：在需要IMV的COVID-19重症患者中，从首次呼吸支持开始插管的延迟与住院死亡率增加和随访期间更差的肺部后遗症相关。

## Protein intake and outcome of critically ill patients: analysis of a large international database using piece-wise exponential additive mixed models

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Proteins are an essential part of medical nutrition therapy in critically ill patients. Guidelines almost universally recommend a high protein intake without robust evidence supporting its use. 

METHODS: Using a large international database, we modelled associations between the hazard rate of in-hospital death and live hospital discharge (competing risks) and three categories of protein intake (low: < 0.8 g/kg per day, standard: 0.8-1.2 g/kg per day, high: > 1.2 g/kg per day) during the first 11 days after ICU admission (acute phase). Time-varying cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) were calculated from piece-wise exponential additive mixed models. We used the estimated model to compare five different hypothetical protein diets (an exclusively low protein diet, a standard protein diet administered early (day 1 to 4) or late (day 5 to 11) after ICU admission, and an early or late high protein diet). 

RESULTS: Of 21,100 critically ill patients in the database, 16,489 fulfilled inclusion criteria for the analysis. By day 60, 11,360 (68.9%) patients had been discharged from hospital, 4,192 patients (25.4%) had died in hospital, and 937 patients (5.7%) were still hospitalized. Median daily low protein intake was 0.49 g/kg [IQR 0.27-0.66], standard intake 0.99 g/kg [IQR 0.89- 1.09], and high intake 1.41 g/kg [IQR 1.29-1.60]. In comparison with an exclusively low protein diet, a late standard protein diet was associated with a lower hazard of in-hospital death: minimum 0.75 (95% CI 0.64, 0.87), and a higher hazard of live hospital discharge: maximum HR 1.98 (95% CI 1.72, 2.28). Results on hospital discharge, however, were qualitatively changed by a sensitivity analysis. There was no evidence that an early standard or a high protein intake during the acute phase was associated with a further improvement of outcome. 

CONCLUSIONS: Provision of a standard protein intake during the late acute phase may improve outcome compared to an exclusively low protein diet. In unselected critically ill patients, clinical outcome may not be improved by a high protein intake during the acute phase. Study registration ID number ISRCTN17829198.

##中文标题- 重症患者的蛋白质摄入量和结局：使用分段指数加性混合模型的大型国际数据库分析

**摘要**

背景：蛋白质是危重患者医学营养治疗的重要组成部分。指南几乎普遍推荐高蛋白摄入，但无有力的证据支持其使用。

方法：使用一个大型国际数据库，我们模拟了院内死亡和存活出院（竞争风险）的风险率与三类蛋白质摄入（低：< 0.8 g/kg/天，标准：0.8-1.2 g/kg/天，高：> 1.2 g/kg/天）。根据分段指数加性混合模型计算随时间变化的特定原因风险比(HR)。我们使用估计模型来比较5种不同的假定蛋白质饮食（单纯的低蛋白饮食、入住ICU后早期（第1-4天）或晚期（第5-11天）给予的标准蛋白质饮食以及早期或晚期高蛋白饮食）。

结果：在数据库中的21,100例重症患者中，16,489例符合分析的入选标准。截至第60天，11,360(68.9%)例患者已出院，4,192(25.4%)例患者在医院死亡，937(5.7%)例患者仍在住院。中位每日低蛋白摄入量为0.49 g/kg[IQR 0.27-0.66]，标准摄入量为0.99 g/kg[IQR 0.89-1.09]，高摄入量为1.41 g/kg[IQR 1.29-1.60]。与单纯的低蛋白饮食相比，较晚的标准蛋白饮食与住院死亡风险降低相关：最低0.75(95%CI 0.64，0.87)，与存活出院风险升高相关：最高HR 1.98(95%CI 1.72，2.28)。但是，通过敏感性分析，对出院结果进行了定性改变。无证据表明，急性期早期标准或大量蛋白质摄入与结局的进一步改善相关。

结论：与单纯低蛋白饮食相比，在急性后期提供标准蛋白质摄入可改善结局。在未经选择的重症患者中，急性期高蛋白质摄入可能不会改善临床结局。研究登记ID编号ISRCTN17829198。

## Hyperoxemia in postsurgical sepsis/septic shock patients is associated with reduced mortality

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Despite growing interest in treatment strategies that limit oxygen exposure in ICU patients, no studies have compared conservative oxygen with standard oxygen in postsurgical patients with sepsis/septic shock, although there are indications that it may improve outcomes. It has been proven that high partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO(2)) reduces the rate of surgical-wound infections and mortality in patients under major surgery. The aim of this study is to examine whether PaO(2) is associated with risk of death in adult patients with sepsis/septic shock after major surgery. 

METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study in 454 patients who underwent major surgery admitted into a single ICU. Patients were stratified in two groups whether they had hyperoxemia, defined as PaO(2) > 100 mmHg (n = 216), or PaO(2) ≤ 100 mmHg (n = 238) at the day of sepsis/septic shock onset according to SEPSIS-3 criteria maintained during 48 h. Primary end-point was 90-day mortality after diagnosis of sepsis. Secondary endpoints were ICU length of stay and time to extubation. 

RESULTS: In patients with PaO(2) ≤ 100 mmHg, we found prolonged mechanical ventilation (2 [8] vs. 1 [4] days, p < 0.001), higher ICU stay (8 [13] vs. 5 [9] days, p < 0.001), higher organ dysfunction as assessed by SOFA score (9 [3] vs. 7 [5], p < 0.001), higher prevalence of septic shock (200/238, 84.0% vs 145/216) 67.1%, p < 0.001), and higher 90-day mortality (37.0% [88] vs. 25.5% [55], p = 0.008). Hyperoxemia was associated with higher probability of 90-day survival in a multivariate analysis (OR 0.61, 95%CI: 0.39-0.95, p = 0.029), independent of age, chronic renal failure, procalcitonin levels, and APACHE II score > 19. These findings were confirmed when patients with severe hypoxemia at the time of study inclusion were excluded. 

CONCLUSIONS: Oxygenation with a PaO(2) above 100 mmHg was independently associated with lower 90-day mortality, shorter ICU stay and intubation time in critically ill postsurgical sepsis/septic shock patients. Our findings open a new venue for designing clinical trials to evaluate the boundaries of PaO(2) in postsurgical patients with severe infections.

##中文标题- 术后败血症/感染性休克患者的高血氧症可降低死亡率

**摘要**

背景：尽管人们对限制ICU患者氧暴露的治疗策略越来越感兴趣，但尚无研究比较在脓毒症/脓毒性休克术后患者中保守氧疗与标准氧疗，尽管有迹象表明其可能改善结局。已证实动脉血氧分压(PaO(2))高可降低大手术患者的手术伤口感染率和死亡率。本研究的目的是调查PaO(2)是否与大手术后脓毒症/脓毒性休克成年患者的死亡风险有关。

方法：我们对一项前瞻性观察性研究进行了二次分析，该研究纳入了454例接受大手术的患者，这些患者均入住同一家ICU。根据48h内维持的sepsis-3标准，患者在脓毒症/脓毒性休克发作当天被分为两组，即PaO(2)> 100 mmHg(n = 216)或PaO(2)≤100 mmHg(n = 238)。主要终点为脓毒症确诊后90天死亡率。次要终点是ICU住院时间和拔管时间。

结果：在PaO(2)≤100 mmHg的患者中，我们发现机械通气时间延长（2[8]对比1[4]天，p < 0.001），ICU住院时间延长（8[13]对比5[9]天，p < 0.001），SOFA评分评估的器官功能障碍更高（9[3]对比7[5]，p < 0.001），感染性休克的患病率更高（200/238，84.0%对比145/216）67.1%，p < 0.001），90天死亡率更高(37.0%[88]vs. 25.5%[55]，p = 0.008)。在多变量分析中，高血氧症与90天生存概率较高相关(OR 0.61，95%CI：0.39-0.95，p = 0.029)，与年龄、慢性肾衰竭、降钙素原水平和APACHE II评分 > 19无关。当排除入选研究时存在重度低氧血症的患者时，这些结果得到证实。

结论：PaO(2)高于100 mmHg的氧合与危重术后脓毒症/脓毒性休克患者的90天死亡率降低、ICU停留时间和插管时间缩短独立相关。我们的发现为设计临床试验以评估PaO(2)在严重感染术后患者中的边界打开了一个新的场所。

## Impact of exposure time in awake prone positioning on clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure treated with high-flow nasal oxygen: a multicenter cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (ARF), awake prone positioning (AW-PP) reduces the need for intubation in patients treated with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO). However, the effects of different exposure times on clinical outcomes remain unclear. We evaluated the effect of AW-PP on the risk of endotracheal intubation and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19-related ARF treated with HFNO and analyzed the effects of different exposure times to AW-PP. 

METHODS: This multicenter prospective cohort study in six ICUs of 6 centers in Argentine consecutively included patients > 18 years of age with confirmed COVID-19-related ARF requiring HFNO from June 2020 to January 2021. In the primary analysis, the main exposure was awake prone positioning for at least 6 h/day, compared to non-prone positioning (NON-PP). In the sensitivity analysis, exposure was based on the number of hours receiving AW-PP. Inverse probability weighting-propensity score (IPW-PS) was used to adjust the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI); and the secondary outcome was hospital mortality. 

RESULTS: During the study period, 580 patients were screened and 335 were included; 187 (56%) tolerated AW-PP for [median (p25-75)] 12 (9-16) h/day and 148 (44%) served as controls. The IPW-propensity analysis showed standardized differences < 0.1 in all the variables assessed. After adjusting for other confounders, the OR (95% CI) for ETI in the AW-PP group was 0.36 (0.2-0.7), with a progressive reduction in OR as the exposure to AW-PP increased. The adjusted OR (95% CI) for hospital mortality in the AW-PP group ≥ 6 h/day was 0.47 (0.19-1.31). The exposure to prone positioning ≥ 8 h/d resulted in a further reduction in OR [0.37 (0.17-0.8)]. 

CONCLUSION: In the study population, AW-PP for ≥ 6 h/day reduced the risk of endotracheal intubation, and exposure ≥ 8 h/d reduced the risk of hospital mortality.

##中文标题- 清醒俯卧位暴露时间对高流量鼻氧治疗COVID-19相关急性呼吸衰竭患者临床结局的影响：多中心队列研究

**摘要**

背景：在COVID-19相关急性呼吸衰竭(ARF)患者中，清醒俯卧位(AW-PP)减少了接受高流量鼻氧(HFNO)治疗的患者的插管需求。然而，不同暴露时间对临床结局的影响尚不清楚。我们评估了AW-PP对接受HFNO治疗的COVID-19相关ARF患者的气管插管风险和住院死亡率的影响，并分析了不同暴露时间对AW-PP的影响。

方法：这项多中心前瞻性队列研究于2020年6月至2021年1月在阿根廷6个中心的6个ICU中连续纳入 > 18岁的需要接受HFNO治疗的确诊COVID-19相关ARF患者。在主要分析中，与非俯卧位(non-PP)相比，主要暴露是清醒俯卧位至少6h/天。在敏感性分析中，暴露基于接受AW-PP的小时数。使用逆概率加权倾向评分(IPW-PS)调整治疗分配的条件概率。主要结局为气管插管(ETI)；次要结局为住院死亡率。

结果：在研究期间，筛选了580例患者，纳入了335例患者；187例(56%)对AW-PP[中位数(p25-75)]12(9-16)h/天耐受，148例(44%)作为对照。IPW倾向分析显示，在评估的所有变量中，标准化差异 < 0.1。调整其他混杂因素后，AW-PP组中ETI的OR(95%CI)为0.36(0.2-0.7)，随着AW-PP暴露增加，OR进行性降低。AW-PP组（≥6h/天）的住院死亡率校正OR(95%CI)为0.47(0.19-1.31)。暴露于俯卧位≥8h/天导致OR进一步降低[0.37(0.17-0.8)]。

结论：在研究人群中，AW-PP≥6h/d降低了气管插管的风险，暴露≥8h/d降低了住院死亡的风险。

## Biomarkers for sepsis: more than just fever and leukocytosis-a narrative review

**Abstract**

A biomarker describes a measurable indicator of a patient's clinical condition that can be measured accurately and reproducibly. Biomarkers offer utility for diagnosis, prognosis, early disease recognition, risk stratification, appropriate treatment (theranostics), and trial enrichment for patients with sepsis or suspected sepsis. In this narrative review, we aim to answer the question, "Do biomarkers in patients with sepsis or septic shock predict mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or organ dysfunction?" We also discuss the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers associated with intestinal permeability, endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, brain injury, and short and long-term mortality. For sepsis, a range of biomarkers is identified, including fluid phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), complement system, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, cell membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors. We also provide an overview of immune response biomarkers that can help identify or differentiate between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. However, significant work is needed to identify the optimal combinations of biomarkers that can augment diagnosis, treatment, and good patient outcomes.

##中文标题- 败血症的生物标志物：不仅仅是发热和白细胞增多-一项叙述性审查

**摘要**

生物标志物描述了患者临床状况的可测量指标，可进行准确且可重复的测量。生物标志物可用于败血症或疑似败血症患者的诊断、预后、早期疾病识别、风险分层、适当治疗（治疗性）和试验富集。在本叙述性综述中，我们旨在回答以下问题：“败血症或感染性休克患者中的生物标志物是否可预测死亡率、多器官功能障碍综合征(MODS)或器官功能障碍？”我们还讨论了促炎和抗炎生物标志物以及与肠道通透性、内皮损伤、器官功能障碍、血脑屏障(BBB)破坏、脑损伤和短期与长期死亡率相关的生物标志物的作用。对于脓毒症，确定了一系列生物标志物，包括液相模式识别分子(PRM)、补体系统、细胞因子、趋化因子、损伤相关分子模式(DAMP)、非编码RNA、小RNA、小RNA、细胞膜受体、细胞蛋白、代谢物和可溶性受体。我们还提供了免疫应答生物标志物的概述，可帮助识别或区分全身炎症反应综合征(SIRS)、败血症、感染性休克和败血症相关性脑病。但是，需要进行大量工作来确定能够增强诊断、治疗和良好患者结局的生物标志物的最佳组合。

## Association between unmet medication needs after hospital discharge and readmission or death among acute respiratory failure survivors: the addressing post-intensive care syndrome (APICS-01) multicenter prospective cohort study

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION: Survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) commonly experience long-lasting physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments. Unmet medication needs occurring immediately after hospital discharge may have an important effect on subsequent recovery. 

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicenter prospective cohort study, we enrolled ARF survivors who were discharged directly home from their acute care hospitalization. The primary exposure was unmet medication needs. The primary outcome was hospital readmission or death within 3 months after discharge. We performed a propensity score analysis, using inverse probability weighting for the primary exposure, to evaluate the exposure-outcome association, with an a priori sample size of 200 ARF survivors. 

RESULTS: We enrolled 200 ARF survivors, of whom 107 (53%) were female and 77 (39%) were people of color. Median (IQR) age was 55 (43-66) years, APACHE II score 20 (15-26) points, and hospital length of stay 14 (9-21) days. Of the 200 participants, 195 (98%) were in the analytic cohort. One hundred fourteen (57%) patients had at least one unmet medication need; the proportion of medication needs that were unmet was 6% (0-15%). Fifty-six (29%) patients were readmitted or died by 3 months; 10 (5%) died within 3 months. Unmet needs were not associated (risk ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.75-2.1) with hospital readmission or death, although a higher proportion of unmet needs may have been associated with increased hospital readmission (risk ratio 1.7; 95% CI 0.96-3.1) and decreased mortality (risk ratio 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.99). DISCUSSION: Unmet medication needs are common among survivors of acute respiratory failure shortly after discharge home. The association of unmet medication needs with 3-month readmission and mortality is complex and requires additional investigation to inform clinical trials of interventions to reduce unmet medication needs. Study registration number: NCT03738774 . The study was prospectively registered before enrollment of the first patient.

##中文标题- 急性呼吸衰竭生存者中出院后未满足的药物需求与再入院或死亡的相关性：解决重症监护后综合征(APICS-01)的多中心前瞻性队列研究

**摘要**

引言：急性呼吸衰竭(ARF)的生存者通常会经历持久的身体、认知和/或心理健康损害。出院后即刻发生的未满足的药物需求可能对随后的恢复有重要影响。

方法和分析：在这项多中心前瞻性队列研究中，我们纳入了从急性护理住院直接出院的ARF存活者。主要暴露为未满足的药物需求。主要结局为再次入院或出院后3个月内死亡。我们使用逆概率加权对主要暴露进行了倾向评分分析，以评估暴露-结局关联，先验样本量为200例ARF存活者。

结果：我们入选了200例ARF生存者，其中107例(53%)为女性，77例(39%)为有色人种。中位(IQR)年龄为55(43-66)岁，APACHE II评分为20(15-26)分，住院时间为14(9-21)天。在200名参与者中，195名(98%)属于分析队列。114例(57%)患者至少有一个未满足的用药需求；未满足的用药需求比例为6%(0-15%)。56例(29%)患者在3个月时再次入院或死亡；10例(5%)在3个月内死亡。未满足的需求与再入院或死亡无关（风险比1.25；95%CI 0.75-2.1），尽管更高比例的未满足需求可能与再入院增加（风险比1.7；95%CI 0.96-3.1）和死亡率降低（风险比0.13；95%CI 0.02-0.99）相关。讨论：出院后不久，急性呼吸衰竭生存者中未满足的药物需求很常见。未满足的药物需求与3个月再入院和死亡率之间的关联是复杂的，需要额外的研究告知临床试验干预措施，以减少未满足的药物需求。研究注册号：NCT03738774。本研究在首例患者入组前进行了前瞻性登记。

## Elevated plasma Galectin-3 is associated with major adverse kidney events and death after ICU admission

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a proinflammatory and profibrotic protein especially overexpressed after Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). The early renal prognostic value of Gal-3 after AKI in critically ill patients remains unexplored. The objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma level of Gal-3 for Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) and mortality 30 days after ICU admission across AKI stages. 

METHODS: This is an ancillary study of a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort (FROG-ICU). AKI was defined using KDIGO definition. 

RESULTS: Two thousand and seventy-six patients had a Gal-3 plasma level measurement at ICU admission. Seven hundred and twenty-three (34.8%) were females and the median age was 63 [51, 74] years. Eight hundred and seven (38.9%) patients developed MAKE, 774 (37.3%) had AKI and mortality rate at 30 days was 22.4% (N = 465). Patients who developed MAKE had higher Gal-3 level at admission compared to patients without (30.2 [20.8, 49.2] ng/ml versus 16.9 [12.7, 24.3] ng/ml, p < 0.001, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of Gal-3 to predict MAKE was 0.76 CI(95%) [0.74-0.78], p < 0.001. Gal-3 was associated with MAKE (OR 1.80 CI(95%) [1.68-1.93], p < 0.001, non-adjusted and OR 1.37 CI(95%) [1.27-1.49], p < 0.001, adjusted). The use of Gal-3 improved prediction performance of prediction model including SAPSII, Screat(adm), pNGAL with a NRI of 0.27 CI(95%)(0.16-0.38), p < 0.001. Median Gal-3 was higher in non-survivors than in survivors at 30 days (29.2 [20.2, 49.2] ng/ml versus 18.8 [13.3, 29.2] ng/ml, p < 0.001, respectively). 

CONCLUSION: Plasma levels of Gal-3 were strongly associated with renal function, with an increased risk of MAKE and death after ICU admission.

##中文标题- 血浆Galectin-3升高与入住ICU后主要肾脏不良事件和死亡相关

**摘要**

背景：半乳糖凝集素-3(Gal-3)是一种促炎性和促纤维化蛋白，尤其在急性肾损伤(AKI)后过度表达。Gal-3在AKI重症患者中的早期肾脏预后价值尚未探索。目的是评估血浆Gal-3水平对AKI各阶段入住ICU后30天主要肾脏不良事件(MAKE)和死亡率的预测价值。

方法：这是一项前瞻性、观察性、多中心队列(FROG-ICU)的辅助研究。采用KDIGO定义定义定义AKI。

结果：在ICU入院时，2766例患者进行了Gal-3血浆水平测量。723例(34.8%)为女性，中位年龄为63[51,74]岁。807例(38.9%)患者发生MAKE，774例(37.3%)发生AKI，30天死亡率为22.4%(N = 465)。发生MAKE的患者入院时Gal-3水平高于未发生MAKE的患者（分别为30.2[20.8，49.2]ng/ml对比16.9[12.7，24.3]ng/ml，p < 0.001）。Gal-3预测MAKE的受试者工作特征曲线下面积为0.76 CI(95%)[0.74-0.78]，p < 0.001。Gal-3与MAKE相关（OR 1.80 CI(95%)[1.68-1.93]，p < 0.001，未调整；OR 1.37 CI(95%)[1.27-1.49]，p < 0.001，调整）。使用Gal-3提高了预测模型的预测性能，包括SAPSII、Screat(adm)、pNGAL，NRI为0.27 CI(95%)(0.16-0.38)，p < 0.001。第30天，非存活者的中位Gal-3高于存活者（29.2[20.2，49.2]ng/ml对比18.8[13.3，29.2]ng/ml，p < 0.001）。

结论：血浆Gal-3水平与肾功能密切相关，入住ICU后MAKE和死亡的风险增加。

## Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Prone positioning (PP) reduces mortality of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The potential benefit of prone positioning maneuvers during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the use of prone positioning during extracorporeal support and ICU mortality in a pooled population of patients from previous European cohort studies. 

METHODS: We performed a pooled individual patient data analysis of European cohort studies which compared patients treated with prone positioning during ECMO (Prone group) to "conventional" ECMO management (Supine group) in patients with severe ARDS. 

RESULTS: 889 patients from five studies were included. Unadjusted ICU mortality was 52.8% in the Supine Group and 40.8% in the Prone group. At a Cox multiple regression analysis PP during ECMO was not significantly associated with a reduction of ICU mortality (HR 0.67 95% CI: 0.42-1.06). Propensity score matching identified 227 patients in each group. ICU mortality of the matched samples was 48.0% and 39.6% for patients in the Supine and Prone group, respectively (p = 0.072). 

CONCLUSIONS: In a large population of ARDS patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal support, the use of prone positioning during ECMO was not significantly associated with reduced ICU mortality. The impact of this procedure will have to be definitively assessed by prospective randomized controlled trials.

##中文标题- 静脉-静脉体外膜肺氧合治疗急性呼吸窘迫综合征期间的俯卧位：一项汇总的个体患者数据分析

**摘要**

背景：俯卧位(PP)降低了急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)患者的死亡率。尚不清楚在静脉-静脉体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)过程中俯卧位操作的潜在获益。本研究的目的是在既往欧洲队列研究的合并患者人群中评估体外支持期间俯卧位的使用与ICU死亡率之间的相关性。

方法：我们对欧洲队列研究进行了汇总的个体患者数据分析，比较了在重度ARDS患者中采用ECMO俯卧位（俯卧位组）和“常规”ECMO管理（仰卧位组）治疗的患者。

结果：纳入5项研究的889例患者。仰卧位组未经调整的ICU死亡率为52.8%，仰卧位组为40.8%。在Cox多元回归分析中，ECMO期间PP与ICU死亡率降低无显著相关性(HR 0.67 95%CI：0.42-1.06)。倾向评分匹配确定每组227例患者。仰卧和仰卧组患者匹配样本的ICU死亡率分别为48.0%和39.6%(p = 0.072)。

结论：在接受静脉-静脉体外支持的大量ARDS患者人群中，ECMO期间采用俯卧位与降低ICU死亡率无显著相关性。必须通过前瞻性随机对照试验明确评估该程序的影响。

## Persistence of live virus in critically ill patients infected with SARS-COV-2: a prospective observational study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Research on the duration of infectivity of ICU patients with COVID-19 has been sparse. Tests based on Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detect both live virus and non-infectious viral RNA. We aimed to determine the duration of infectiousness based on viral culture of nasopharyngeal samples of patients with COVID-19. 

METHODS: Prospective observational study in adult intensive care units with a diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia. Patients had repeated nasopharyngeal sampling performed after day 10 of ICU admission. Culture positive rate (based on viral culture on Vero cells in a level 4 lab) and Cycle threshold from RT-PCR were measured. 

RESULTS: Nine patients of the 108 samples (8.3%, 95% CI 3.9-15.2%) grew live virus at a median of 13 days (interquartile range 11-19) after their initial positive test. 74.1% of patients were RT-PCR positive but culture negative, and the remaining (17.6%) were RT-PCR and culture negative. Cycle threshold showed excellent ability to predict the presence of live virus, with a Ct < 25 with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.97, p < 0.001). The specificity of a Ct > 25 to predict negative viral culture was 100% (95% CI 70-100%). 

CONCLUSION: 8.3% of our ICU patients with COVID-19 grew live virus at a median of 13 days post-initial positive RT-PCR test. Severity of illness, use of mechanical ventilation, and time between tests did not predict the presence of live virus. Cycle threshold of > 25 had the best ability to determine the lack of live virus in these patents.

##中文标题- 感染SARS-COV-2的重症患者中活病毒的持续性：一项前瞻性观察研究

**摘要**

背景：关于ICU患者使用COVID-19的感染持续时间的研究很少。基于逆转录聚合酶链反应(RT-PCR)的检测，可同时检测活病毒和非感染性病毒RNA。我们旨在根据COVID-19患者的鼻咽样本病毒培养确定感染持续时间。

方法：在诊断为COVID-19肺炎的成人重症监护室中进行的前瞻性观察性研究。患者在进入ICU后第10天重复进行鼻咽采样。测量了培养阳性率（基于4级实验室Vero细胞的病毒培养）和RT-PCR的周期阈值。

结果：108份样本中有9例患者(8.3%，95%CI 3.9-15.2%)在初次阳性检测后中位13天（四分位距11-19）长出活病毒。74.1%的患者为RT-PCR阳性但培养阴性，其余(17.6%)为RT-PCR和培养阴性。阈值循环显示出很好的预测活病毒存在的能力，Ct < 25，AUC为0.90(95%CI 0.83-0.97，p < 0.001)。Ct > 25预测病毒培养阴性的特异性为100%(95%CI 70-100%)。

结论：8.3%的COVID-19 ICU患者在初次RT-PCR检测阳性后中位13天有活病毒生长。疾病的严重程度、机械通气的使用和检测之间的时间不能预测活病毒的存在。循环阈值 > 25时，确定这些专利中无活病毒的能力最好。

## Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia: a European multicenter comparative cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Recent multicenter studies identified COVID-19 as a risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, no large multicenter study has compared the incidence of IPA between COVID-19 and influenza patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of putative IPA in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients, compared with influenza patients. 

METHODS: This study was a planned ancillary analysis of the coVAPid multicenter retrospective European cohort. Consecutive adult patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for > 48 h for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia or influenza pneumonia were included. The 28-day cumulative incidence of putative IPA, based on Blot definition, was the primary outcome. IPA incidence was estimated using the Kalbfleisch and Prentice method, considering extubation (dead or alive) within 28 days as competing event. 

RESULTS: A total of 1047 patients were included (566 in the SARS-CoV-2 group and 481 in the influenza group). The incidence of putative IPA was lower in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia group (14, 2.5%) than in influenza pneumonia group (29, 6%), adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio (cHR) 3.29 (95% CI 1.53-7.02, p = 0.0006). When putative IPA and Aspergillus respiratory tract colonization were combined, the incidence was also significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 group, as compared to influenza group (4.1% vs. 10.2%), adjusted cHR 3.21 (95% CI 1.88-5.46, p < 0.0001). In the whole study population, putative IPA was associated with significant increase in 28-day mortality rate, and length of ICU stay, compared with colonized patients, or those with no IPA or Aspergillus colonization. 

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the incidence of putative IPA was low. Its incidence was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia than in those with influenza pneumonia. Clinical trial registration The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04359693 .

##中文标题- SARS-CoV-2或流感肺炎气管插管患者中的侵袭性肺曲霉病：一项欧洲多中心比较队列研究

**摘要**

背景：近期的多中心研究确定COVID-19是侵袭性肺曲霉病(IPA)的风险因素。然而，尚无大型多中心研究比较COVID-19与流感患者的IPA发生率。目的：确定与流感患者相比，SARS-CoV-2重症患者推定的IPA发生率。

方法：本研究是coVAPid多中心回顾性欧洲队列的计划辅助分析。连续纳入因SARS-CoV-2肺炎或流感肺炎而需要有创机械通气 > 48 h的成年患者。基于印迹法定义的推定IPA的28天累积发生率为主要结局。使用Kalbfleisch和Prentice方法估计IPA发生率，考虑28天内拔管（死亡或存活）为竞争事件。

结果：共纳入1047例患者（SARS-CoV-2组566例，流感组481例）。SARS-CoV-2肺炎组推定的IPA发病率(14，2.5%)低于流感肺炎组(29，6%)，校正的病因特异性风险比(cHR)为3.29(95%CI 1.53-7.02，p = 0.0006)。当合并推定的IPA和曲霉菌呼吸道定植时，SARS-CoV-2组的发病率也显著低于流感组(4.1%vs. 10.2%)，校正的cHR为3.21(95%CI 1.88-5.46，p < 0.0001)。在整个研究人群中，与定植患者或无IPA或曲霉菌定植的患者相比，推定的IPA与28天死亡率和ICU住院时间显著增加相关。

结论：总体而言，推定的IPA发生率较低。其在SARS-CoV-2肺炎患者中的发病率显著低于流感肺炎患者。临床试验注册该研究注册于ClinicalTrials.gov编号NCT04359693。

## Respiratory effects of lung recruitment maneuvers depend on the recruitment-to-inflation ratio in patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: In the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the response to lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) varies considerably from one patient to another and so is difficult to predict. The aim of the study was to determine whether or not the recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio could differentiate between patients according to the change in lung mechanics during the LRM. 

METHODS: We evaluated the changes in gas exchange and respiratory mechanics induced by a stepwise LRM at a constant driving pressure of 15 cmH(2)O during pressure-controlled ventilation. We assessed lung recruitability by measuring the R/I ratio. Patients were dichotomized with regard to the median R/I ratio. 

RESULTS: We included 30 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and a median [interquartile range] R/I ratio of 0.62 [0.42-0.83]. After the LRM, patients with high recruitability (R/I ratio ≥ 0.62) presented an improvement in the P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio, due to significant increase in respiratory system compliance (33 [27-42] vs. 42 [35-60] mL/cmH(2)O; p < 0.001). In low recruitability patients (R/I < 0.62), the increase in P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio was associated with a significant decrease in pulse pressure as a surrogate of cardiac output (70 [55-85] vs. 50 [51-67] mmHg; p = 0.01) but not with a significant change in respiratory system compliance (33 [24-47] vs. 35 [25-47] mL/cmH(2)O; p = 0.74). 

CONCLUSION: After the LRM, patients with high recruitability presented a significant increase in respiratory system compliance (indicating a gain in ventilated area), while those with low recruitability presented a decrease in pulse pressure suggesting a drop in cardiac output and therefore in intrapulmonary shunt.

##中文标题- 肺复张操作的呼吸效应取决于COVID-19相关急性呼吸窘迫综合征患者的新陈代谢与充气比值

**摘要**

背景：在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)的背景下，不同患者对肺复张操作(lcrm)的反应差异很大，因此难以预测。本研究的目的是根据LRM期间肺力学的变化，确定肺复张/充气(R/I)比值是否能够区分患者之间的差异。

方法：我们评估了压力控制通气期间，在恒定驱动压力15 cmh2 O下，逐步LRM诱导的气体交换和呼吸力学变化。我们通过测量R/I比值来评估肺复张性。对患者的中位R/I比值进行二分化。

结果：我们纳入了30例中重度ARDS患者，中位[四分位距]R/I比值为0.62[0.42-0.83]。LRM后，由于呼吸系统顺应性显著增加(33[27-42]vs. 42[35-60]mL/cmh2)，高招募性（R/I比率≥0.62）患者的P(a)o2/F(I)o2比率改善(P < 0.001)。在低招募性患者(R/I < 0.62)中，P(a)O(2)/F(I)O(2)比率的升高与作为心输出量替代指标的脉压显著下降相关(70[55-85]vs. 50[51-67]mmHg；P = 0.01)，但与呼吸系统顺应性的显著变化无关（33[24-47]vs. 35[25-47]mL/cmH(2)O;p = 0.74).

结论：LRM后，高招募性患者呼吸系统顺应性显著增加（表明通气面积增加），而低招募性患者脉压下降，表明心输出量下降，因此出现肺内分流。

## Vitamin C for ≥ 5 days is associated with decreased hospital mortality in sepsis subgroups: a nationwide cohort study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Previous randomized trials of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine on sepsis were limited by short-term vitamin C administration, heterogeneous populations, and the failure to evaluate each component's effect. The purpose of this study was to determine whether vitamin C alone for ≥ 5 days or in combination with corticosteroids and/or thiamine was associated with decreased mortality across the sepsis population and subpopulation. 

METHODS: Nationwide population-based study conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. A total of 384,282 adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled from January 2017 to December 2019. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, while the key secondary outcome was 90-day mortality. 

RESULTS: The mean [standard deviation] age was 69.0 [15.4] years; 57% were male; and 36,327 (9%) and 347,955 did and did not receive vitamin C, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group involved 36,327 patients. The hospital mortality was lower by - 0.9% in the treatment group (17.1% vs 18.0%; 95% confidence interval, - 1.3 to - 0.5%; p < 0.001), a significant but extremely small difference. However, mortality decreased greater in patients who received vitamin C for ≥ 5 days (vs 1-2 or 3-4 days) (15.8% vs 18.8% vs 18.3%; p < 0.001). Further, vitamin C was associated with a lower hospital mortality in patients with older age, multiple comorbidities, pneumonia, genitourinary infection, septic shock, and mechanical ventilation. Consistent findings were found for 90-day mortality. Moreover, vitamin C alone or in combination with thiamine was significantly associated with decreased hospital mortality. 

CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous vitamin C of ≥ 5 days was significantly associated with decreased hospital and 90-day mortality in sepsis patients. Vitamin C combined with corticosteroids and/or thiamine in specific sepsis subgroups warrants further study.

##中文标题- 维生素C治疗≥5天与败血症亚组住院死亡率降低相关：全国队列研究

**摘要**

背景：既往维生素C、氢化可的松和硫胺素对脓毒症的随机试验受到维生素C短期给药、异质性人群以及未能评价每种成分作用的限制。本研究的目的是确定在脓毒症人群和亚群中，维生素C单独使用≥5天或与糖皮质激素和/或硫胺素联合使用是否与死亡率降低相关。

方法：使用韩国国民健康保险服务数据库进行全国人群研究。2017年1月至2019年12月期间，共入组384,282例入住重症监护室的成人脓毒症患者。主要结局为住院死亡率，关键次要结局为90天死亡率。

结果：平均[标准差]年龄为69.0[15.4]岁；57%为男性；有36,327名(9%)和347,955名分别接受和未接受维生素C。倾向评分匹配后，每组涉及36,327例患者。治疗组的住院死亡率降低了0.9%（17.1%对比18.0%；95%置信区间，-1.3至-0.5%；p < 0.001），差异显著但极小。然而，接受维生素C治疗≥5天的患者中死亡率下降幅度更大（1-2天或3-4天）(15.8%vs 18.8%vs 18.3%；p < 0.001)。此外，在年龄较大、有多种合并症、肺炎、泌尿生殖系统感染、感染性休克和机械通气的患者中，维生素C与较低的住院死亡率相关。90天死亡率的结果一致。此外，维生素C单独使用或与硫胺素联合使用与住院死亡率降低显著相关。

结论：静脉注射维生素C≥5天与败血症患者住院率和90天死亡率下降显著相关。维生素C联合皮质类固醇和/或硫胺素治疗特定败血症亚组需要进一步研究。

## Mechanical power in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a PARDIE study

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: Mechanical power is a composite variable for energy transmitted to the respiratory system over time that may better capture risk for ventilator-induced lung injury than individual ventilator management components. We sought to evaluate if mechanical ventilation management with a high mechanical power is associated with fewer ventilator-free days (VFD) in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). 

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective observational international cohort study. 

RESULTS: There were 306 children from 55 pediatric intensive care units included. High mechanical power was associated with younger age, higher oxygenation index, a comorbid condition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, higher tidal volume, higher delta pressure (peak inspiratory pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure), and higher respiratory rate. Higher mechanical power was associated with fewer 28-day VFD after controlling for confounding variables (per 0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1) Subdistribution Hazard Ratio (SHR) 0.93 (0.87, 0.98), p = 0.013). Higher mechanical power was not associated with higher intensive care unit mortality in multivariable analysis in the entire cohort (per 0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1) OR 1.12 [0.94, 1.32], p = 0.20). But was associated with higher mortality when excluding children who died due to neurologic reasons (per 0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1) OR 1.22 [1.01, 1.46], p = 0.036). In subgroup analyses by age, the association between higher mechanical power and fewer 28-day VFD remained only in children < 2-years-old (per 0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1) SHR 0.89 (0.82, 0.96), p = 0.005). Younger children were managed with lower tidal volume, higher delta pressure, higher respiratory rate, lower positive end-expiratory pressure, and higher PCO(2) than older children. No individual ventilator management component mediated the effect of mechanical power on 28-day VFD. 

CONCLUSIONS: Higher mechanical power is associated with fewer 28-day VFDs in children with PARDS. This association is strongest in children < 2-years-old in whom there are notable differences in mechanical ventilation management. While further validation is needed, these data highlight that ventilator management is associated with outcome in children with PARDS, and there may be subgroups of children with higher potential benefit from strategies to improve lung-protective ventilation. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Higher mechanical power is associated with fewer 28-day ventilator-free days in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. This association is strongest in children <2-years-old in whom there are notable differences in mechanical ventilation management.

##中文标题- 机械通气在急性呼吸窘迫综合征患儿中的应用：一项PARDIE研究

**摘要**

背景：机械动力是随时间推移传递至呼吸系统的能量的复合变量，与单独的呼吸机管理组件相比，可能更好地捕获呼吸机诱导肺损伤的风险。我们试图评估在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(PARDS)患儿中，高机械功率的机械通气管理是否与较少的无呼吸机天数(VFD)相关。

方法：前瞻性观察性国际队列研究的回顾性分析。

结果：共有306名儿童来自55个儿科重症监护室。高机械功率与年龄较小、氧合指数较高、合并存在支气管肺发育不良、潮气量较高、δ压（吸气峰压-呼气末正压）较高和呼吸率较高相关。在控制混杂变量（每0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1)子分布风险比(SHR)0.93(0.87，0.98)，p = 0.013）后，较高的机械功率与较少的28天VFD相关。在整个队列的多变量分析中（每0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1)OR 1.12[0.94，1.32]，p = 0.20），较高的机械功率与较高的重症监护室死亡率无关。但当排除因神经系统原因死亡的儿童时，死亡率更高（每0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1)或1.22[1.01，1.46]，p = 0.036）。在按年龄进行的亚组分析中，较高的机械功率与较少的28天VFD之间的相关性仅在 < 2岁的儿童中存在（每0.1 J·min(-1)·Kg(-1)SHR 0.89(0.82，0.96)，p = 0.005）。较年幼儿童的潮气量较年长儿童更低，δ压更高，呼吸频率更高，呼气末正压更低，PCO(2)更高。没有单独的呼吸机管理组件介导机械功率对28天VFD的影响。

结论：在PARDS儿童中，较高的机械功率与较少的28天VFD相关。这种相关性在机械通气管理存在显著差异的2岁以下儿童中最强。尽管需要进一步验证，但这些数据强调，呼吸机管理与PARDS儿童的结局相关，并且可能有亚组儿童从改善肺保护通气的策略中获得更高的潜在获益。家庭消息：较高的机械功率与儿科急性呼吸窘迫综合征患儿较少的28天无呼吸机治疗天数相关。这种相关性在机械通气管理存在显著差异的2岁以下儿童中最强。

## Sildenafil for treating patients with COVID-19 and perfusion mismatch: a pilot randomized trial

**Abstract**

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 seems to affect the regulation of pulmonary perfusion. Hypoperfusion in areas of well-aerated lung parenchyma results in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch that can be characterized using subtraction computed tomography angiography (sCTA). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral sildenafil in treating COVID-19 inpatients showing perfusion abnormalities in sCTA. 

METHODS: Triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Chile in a tertiary-care hospital able to provide on-site sCTA scans and ventilatory support when needed between August 2020 and March 2021. In total, 82 eligible adults were admitted to the ED with RT-PCR-confirmed or highly probable SARS-COV-2 infection and sCTA performed within 24 h of admission showing perfusion abnormalities in areas of well-aerated lung parenchyma; 42 were excluded and 40 participants were enrolled and randomized (1:1 ratio) once hospitalized. The active intervention group received sildenafil (25 mg orally three times a day for seven days), and the control group received identical placebo capsules in the same way. Primary outcomes were differences in oxygenation parameters measured daily during follow-up (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and A-a gradient). Secondary outcomes included admission to the ICU, requirement of non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality rates. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. 

RESULTS: Totally, 40 participants were enrolled (20 in the placebo group and 20 in the sildenafil group); 33 [82.5%] were male; and median age was 57 [IQR 41-68] years. No significant differences in mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios and A-a gradients were found between groups (repeated-measures ANOVA p = 0.67 and p = 0.69). IMV was required in 4 patients who received placebo and none in the sildenafil arm (logrank p = 0.04). Patients in the sildenafil arm showed a significantly shorter median length of hospital stay than the placebo group (9 IQR 7-12 days vs. 12 IQR 9-21 days, p = 0.04). 

CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences were found in the oxygenation parameters. Sildenafil treatment could have a potential therapeutic role regarding the need for IMV in COVID-19 patients with specific perfusion patterns in sCTA. A large-scale study is needed to confirm these results.

##中文标题- 西地那非治疗COVID-19和灌注不匹配患者：一项初探性随机试验

**摘要**

背景：SARS-CoV-2似乎影响肺灌注的调节。充气良好的肺实质区域低灌注导致通气-灌注不匹配，可使用减影计算机断层扫描血管造影(sCTA)描述。本研究旨在评价口服西地那非治疗sCTA中显示灌注异常的COVID-19住院患者的疗效。

方法：在智利的一家三级医院进行了三盲、随机、安慰剂对照试验，该医院能够在2020年8月至2021年3月期间提供现场sCTA扫描和需要时的通气支持。共有82例合格成人进入ED，伴有RT-PCR证实的或高度可能的SARS-COV-2感染，且在入院24h内进行的sCTA显示充气良好的肺实质区域灌注异常；42例被排除，40例受试者入组并在住院后进行随机分组（1:1比例）。活性干预组接受西地那非（25 mg口服，每日3次，持续7天），对照组以相同方式接受相同的安慰剂胶囊。主要结局为随访期间每日测量的氧合参数的差异（PaO(2)/FiO(2)比率和A-A梯度）。次要结局包括入住ICU、需要无创通气、有创机械通气(IMV)和死亡率。以意向治疗为基础进行分析。

结果：共入组40例受试者（安慰剂组20例，西地那非组20例）；33例[82.5%]为男性；中位年龄为57岁[IQR 41-68]岁。没有发现组间平均PaO(2)/FiO(2)比率和A-A梯度存在显著差异（重复测量ANOVA p = 0.67和p = 0.69）。4例接受安慰剂的患者需要IMV，西地那非组无需IMV（对数秩p = 0.04）。西地那非组患者的中位住院时间显著短于安慰剂组（9 IQR 7-12天与12 IQR 9-21天，p = 0.04）。

结论：未发现氧合参数存在统计学显著性差异。就sCTA中具有特定灌注模式的COVID-19患者对IMV的需求而言，西地那非治疗可能具有潜在的治疗作用。需要进行大规模研究来确认这些结果。
