However, several other imaging modalities including magnetic resonance and computed tomographic venography are superior to ultrasonography, but their clinical use may be limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and/or availability. The sensitivity of compression duplex ultrasonography is 97%, which is lower than magnetic resonance venography (100%). However, it is non-invasive, less expensive and widely available, thus remains the test of choice to diagnose upper extremity DVT. Laboratory studies are not required for diagnosis, but a coagulation assay can be ordered in patients suspected of having a hypercoagulable condition.
