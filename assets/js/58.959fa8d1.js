Animal and validation studies were excluded.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Two authors collected and assessed the data\nindependently. The studies were grouped into two sets according to the\ntype of analysis used to assess the relationship between cerebral\nautoregulation indices and predictors of outcome (standardized mean\ndifferences or R).\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-three studies compared cerebral autoregulation\nindices and patient outcomes using standardized mean differences, and 20\nused Rs. The only data available for meta-analysis were from patients\nwith traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Based on z score\nanalysis, the best three cerebral autoregulation index predictors of\nmortality or Glasgow Outcome Scale for patients with traumatic brain\ninjury were the pressure reactivity index, transcranial Doppler-derived\nmean velocity index based on cerebral perfusion pressure, and\nautoregulation reactivity index (z scores: 8.97, 6.01, 3.94,\nrespectively). Mean velocity index based on arterial blood pressure did\nnot reach statistical significance for predicting outcome measured as a\ncontinuous variable (p = 0.07) for patients with traumatic brain injury.\nFor patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, autoregulation reactivity\nindex was the only cerebral autoregulation index that predicted patient\noutcome measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale as a continuous outcome\n(R = 0.82; p = 0.001; z score, 3.39). We found a significant correlation\nbetween the duration of monitoring and predictive value for mortality\n(R = 0.78; p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Three cerebral autoregulation indices, pressure reactivity\nindex, mean velocity index based on cerebral perfusion pressure, and\nautoregulation reactivity index were the best outcome predictors for\npatients with traumatic brain injury. For patients with subarachnoid\nhemorrhage, autoregulation reactivity index was the only cerebral\nautoregulation index predictor of Glasgow Outcome Scale. Continuous\nassessment of cerebral autoregulation predicted outcome better than\nintermittent monitoring.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
